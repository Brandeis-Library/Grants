are coordinated and influence each other. To address this question, I will use the budding yeast S. cerevisiae,
where septins were first discovered, and where I am readily able to combine a ‘bottom up’ in vitro reconstitution
and single molecule imaging approach with a ‘top down’ genetics and live imaging approach. The proposal builds
off of recent discoveries made in the Goode lab, which reveal that septins are organized at the yeast bud neck
into 8-10 evenly-spaced bars, or “pillars”, which co-align with F-actin cables used for intracellular transport. While
work in a number of model organisms has closely linked the in vivo functions of septins and actin, we still have
only a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this septin-actin crosstalk. The goal of this
proposal is to define these mechanisms. S. cerevisiae express 5 different septin proteins, which co-polymerize
into filaments and are further organized into higher order structures. My preliminary data show that one of the
septins (Shs1) mediates direct binding to F-actin in vitro, and that loss of SHS1 disrupts actin cable architecture
and function in vivo. In Aim1, I will use targeted mutagenesis to generate new shs1 separation-of-function
mutants disrupting F-actin binding. I will then use these mutants to investigate how Shs1-mediated F-actin
binding contributes to the alignment of actin cables with septin pillars in vivo, and intracellular transport of
secretory vesicles. In Aim2, I will reconstitute purified septin oligomers and filaments decorated with actin-
nucleating formins (Bnr1) and formin-regulatory proteins (e.g., Gin4, Bud6, and the Mlc1-Iqg1-Hof1 complex),
and define their effects on F-actin assembly and organization by TIRF microscopy and single molecule imaging.
These experiments will test several important hypotheses, including: (1) whether septins and Gin4 activate full-
length Bnr1 from autoinhibition to promote actin assembly; (2) whether Iqg1 has regulatory effects on F-actin
and Bnr1, like its human counterpart IQGAP1 (based on a recent study from the Goode lab; Hoeprich et al.,
2022); and (3) whether septin oligomers/filaments themselves (via Shs1) directly influence F-actin bundling and
dynamics. In parallel to these in vitro experiments, I will acutely deplete the same proteins in vivo (using degron
tags) to determine how each contributes to the assembly and alignment of actin cables at the bud neck. My
preliminary data already point to an exciting new role for Iqg1 in controlling actin cable formation during polarized
cell growth. Together, the in vitro and in vivo work outlined in this proposal will: (i) clarify how septins, formins,
and formin-regulatory proteins work in concert to shape actin networks, (ii) define new subunit-specific roles for
septins in actin regulation, (iii) lay a strong foundation for launching my own lab focused on septin-actin crosstalk,
and (iv) provide new leads that will allow me to extend this work in the future (on my own and via collaboration)
into other systems.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MAGLIOZZI, JOSEPH O</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31AG079515</grantId><grantName>The Role of Dopamine in Cognitive Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Healthy Older Adults</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>33846.0</amount><startDate>2023-11-03</startDate><endDate /><keyword>Acceleration, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, Affect, ages, Age, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Elderly, Aging, AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, Attention, Berry, Boston, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Cognition, Concurrent Studies, Cohort Studies, Communication, Disease, Disorder, Dopamine, Hydroxytyramine, Faculty, Genes, Goals, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, General Hospitals, Human, Modern Man, Maintenance, Massachusetts, Memory, Mentors, Mentorship, Midbrain structure, Mesencephalon, Mid-brain, Midbrain, Methods, Motivation, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neuropsychology, Neuropsychologies, neuropsychologic, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Parkinson Disease, Parkinson, Primary Parkinsonism, Paralysis Agitans, Pathology, Positron-Emission Tomography, PET, PET Scan, PET imaging, PETSCAN, PETT, Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography Scan, Rad.-PET, positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging, positron emission tomographic imaging, positron emitting tomography, Research, Research Support, Rest, Role, social role, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, statistics, Testing, tomography, Traction, Universities, Upregulation, Up-Regulation, Work, Amyloid beta-Protein, Alzheimer beta-Protein, Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein, Alzheimer's amyloid, Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein, Amyloid Beta-Peptide, Amyloid Protein A4, Amyloid β, Amyloid β-Peptide, Amyloid β-Protein, Aβ, a beta peptide, abeta, amyloid beta, amyloid-b protein, beta amyloid fibril, soluble amyloid precursor protein, Measures, Neurofibrillary Tangles, neurofibrillary degeneration, neurofibrillary lesion, neurofibrillary pathology, tangle, Youth, Youth 10-21, Prefrontal Cortex, career, human subject, Anterior, Medial, Site, Acute, Link, Susceptibility, Predisposition, Training, Memory Deficit, memory dysfunction, Memory impairment, insight, Individual, adult youth, young adulthood, young adult, Therapeutic, Metabolic, Amyloid (Aβ) plaques, Amyloid Plaques, Neuritic Plaques, amyloid beta plaque, amyloid-b plaque, aβ plaques, cored plaque, diffuse plaque, Senile Plaques, Cognitive Disturbance, Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive decline, Cognitive function abnormal, Disturbance in cognition, cognitive dysfunction, cognitive loss, Impaired cognition, Functional MRI, fMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, cognitive function, Pattern, System, brain tissue, interest, college, collegiate, experience, Performance, cingulate cortex, neuroregulation, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, Animal Model, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, neural, Proxy, Structure, neuroimaging, neuro-imaging, neurological imaging, Prevention Research, Sampling, neuropathology, neuropathologic, neuropathological, Intervention, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, Neuromodulator, Qualifying, in vivo, Cognitive, Rodent Model, Pathologic, Monitor, Process, Development, developmental, blood oxygen level dependent, blood oxygenation level dependent, cognitive reserve, age related, age dependent, age effect, aging effect, resilience, resilient, Population, Prevalence, Cognitive aging, neuromechanism, neural mechanism, innovation, innovate, innovative, healthy aging, dopamine system, cognitive performance, cognitive testing, cognitive assessment, Alzheimer's disease pathology, AD pathology, Alzheimer's pathology, neuroimaging marker, neuroimaging biomarker, preservation, Alzheimer’s disease biomarker, Alzheimer's biomarker, Alzheimer's disease biological marker, Alzheimer’s biological marker, Alzheimer's disease therapeutic, Alzheimer's therapeutic, multimodal neuroimaging, multi-modal neuro-imaging, multi-modal neuroimaging, multimodal neuro-imaging, Compensation,</keyword><description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid and tau neuropathology, which are linked to disruptions
in memory performance. Advances in human neuroimaging approaches that quantify pathology in vivo have
revealed a promising target for AD therapeutics known as cognitive reserve, which is the capacity for some
individuals to have better-than-expected cognition given their level of pathology. Our proposed research
examines the role of brain dopamine in maintaining optimal cognitive function and youth-like patterns of brain
activity despite pathology. Successful maintenance of dopamine function in aging may protect against pathology-
related alterations in cognition as dopamine inputs directly into the hippocampus and supports optimal memory
performance. The functional impact of hippocampal AD-related pathology can be assessed in humans using
emerging fMRI analysis methods that measure local functional connectivity (i.e. regional homogeneity). This is
a sensitive predictor of memory performance and pathology burden in rodent models and humans and is gaining
traction as a functional neuroimaging biomarker. Local functional connectivity is also affected by
neuromodulator systems like dopamine, which may support compensatory changes in aging and could have
applications for AD. The extent to which AD-related pathology accumulation in aging interacts with dopamine
neuromodulator functions to affect local functional connectivity and memory is not known. The proposed
research will fill this gap by assessing, within an older adult sample, relationships among memory, positron
emission tomography (PET) measured AD-related pathology (tau) and dopamine synthesis capacity, and local
functional connectivity in AD-vulnerable regions. Connectivity will be measured with resting-state fMRI, and
memory will be measured with standard neuropsychological assessment. The proposed research will examine
interactions between dopamine synthesis capacity and tau pathology to test the hypothesis that elevated
dopamine synthesis capacity counteracts effects of pathology on memory and local functional connectivity, thus
representing a cognitive reserve mechanism. Aim 1 will establish age and tau pathology effects on local functional
connectivity in AD-vulnerable regions. Aim 2 will investigate interactive effects of dopamine synthesis capacity
and AD pathology on local functional connectivity and memory in older adults. This proposal uniquely integrates
AD-relevant research and dopamine mechanisms in human subjects and may support AD treatment efforts.
Completion of this research will achieve the applicant’s training goals including training in (1) multi-modal
neuroimaging, (2) memory systems in aging, (3) statistics (4) scientific communication, and (5) mentorship.
Brandeis University, Boston College, and Massachusetts General Hospital provide exceptional faculty and
neuroimaging facilities. Dr. Anne Berry (sponsor) and Dr. Elizabeth Kensinger (co-sponsor) are experienced
mentors and specialize in cognitive aging, fMRI, PET, and memory systems. The proposed project and training
will successfully advance the applicant’s qualifications for successful pursuit of a career in aging and AD,
dopamine, and memory systems.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PARENT, JOURDAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2309635</grantId><grantName>Computational modeling to

numbers of people homeless and creating poor health conditions in precarious, concentrated homeless
encampments. In Boston, Massachusetts, an October 2021 public health emergency declaration preceded a
January 2022 massive relocation campaign that moved over 200 people from a large street encampment into 5
novel “harm reduction housing” (HRH) programs. The area is known for its proximity to area hospitals, its
open-air drug market, and violence related to drugs and crime. These programs provide housing units with
access to harm reduction supplies like sterile syringes and other safer use materials, naloxone, and low-barrier
medication treatment, and staff provide these services according to policies that champion the principles of
“meeting people where they are”. But the HRH sites differ in ways that may affect resident outcomes, and
uptake of services vary. Data suggest that housing interventions may tragically increase isolation and thus
overdose risk; others claim lives will be saved and life-saving treatments will start because of their improved
access at the HRH sites. An initial case-crossover analysis of those recently relocated echoed a mixture of
positive and negative effects. Lacking clear-cut, scientifically rigorous processes that consider both intended
and unintended consequences of these actions, we propose a rapid, mixed methods study to efficiently examine
the immediate effects of the relocation efforts and the longer-term impacts of living in the novel HRH.
Specifically, this time-sensitive study will collect survey, interview, and drug supply data from the community
of people who are homeless and use drugs in the concentrated area of Boston who have been affected by these
recent actions. The study will help to determine short and long-term impacts of: a) rapid relocation and how
residents successfully navigated it; and b) co-provision of harm reduction services and housing on individual-
level behaviors and local drug supply outcomes. Specific aims are to: Aim 1) Develop a measure of harm
reduction services and policies to inventory their provision and use in HRH sites for studying continuity,
uptake, and evolution of care. Aim 2) Enroll an observational cohort following 100 HRH residents for 12
months to catalogue relocation effects and understand how harm reduction services use changes drug use, HIV
and drug risk behaviors, treatment uptake, and the local drug supply. Data specific to new HRH resident cohort
members will augment our prior case-crossover analysis of relocation impacts. Aim 3) Conduct repeat,
longitudinal one-on-one interviews with 25 cohort members to gain greater insight into the nuances of
relocation and HRH residence, including health and safety impacts, changes in collective efficacy, and gender
considerations. Findings will contribute to harm reduction science and will be directly relevant to jurisdictions
considering HRH, adapting housing contracts to incorporate harm reduction services, and planning public
health-directed mitigation plans for housing relocations or disaster responses.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GREEN, TRACI C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>CH5074510</grantId><grantName>CONNECTING THE HUMANITIES: INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING FOR THE NEW MANDEL CENTER FOR THE HUMANITIES</grantName><funderCode>418</funderCode><funderAgency>National Endowment for the Humanities</funderAgency><amount>573333.0</amount><startDate>2007-12-01</startDate><endDate>2015-07-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AG082109</grantId><grantName>Systematic and mechanistic assessment of the roles of circRNAs in Alzheimer's Disease</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>243750.0</amount><startDate>2023-04-15</startDate><endDate>2025-01-31</endDate><keyword>ages, Age, Aging, AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, Animals, autophagy, Autophagocytosis, Awareness, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Disease, Disorder, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Exons, Eye, Eyeball, Gene Expression, Genetic Screening, Health, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Human, Modern Man, Incidence, Inflammation, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Libraries, Longevity, Length of Life, life span, lifespan, Methodology, Mitochondria, mitochondrial, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Parkinson Disease, Parkinson, Primary Parkinsonism, Paralysis Agitans, Pathology, Phenotype, Post-Translational Protein Processing, Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry, Post-Translational Modifications, Post-Translational Protein Modification, Posttranslational Modifications, Posttranslational Protein Processing, Protein Modification, Proteins, Research, Resources, Research Resources, RNA, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, Role, social role, Testing, Time, Body Tissues, Tissues, Work, circular RNA, closed circular RNA, RNA-Binding Proteins, tau Proteins, MT-bound tau, microtubule bound tau, microtubule-bound tau, tau, tau factor, τ Proteins, Mediating, Apoptosis Pathway, Programmed Cell Death, Apoptosis, improved, Area, Surface, Link, Nervous System Poisoning, Neurotoxic Disorders, Neurotoxin Diseases, Neurotoxin Disorders, Neurotoxicity Syndromes, Individual, Oxidative Stress, Disease Progression, Genetic, tool, System, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Neural Degenerative Diseases, Neural degenerative Disorders, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons, degenerative neurological diseases, neurodegenerative illness, Neurodegenerative Disorders, protein metabolism, success, Animal Model, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, neural, Disease Outcome, Disease model, disorder model, Pathogenesis, Regulation, Modeling, Genomics, disorder control, disease control, MicroRNAs, Micro RNA, miRNA, miRNAs, Defect, Data, Motor, in vivo, Collection, Whole Organism, Molecular, Development, developmental, Behavioral, fly, Flies, Pathway interactions, pathway, age related, age dependent, knock-down, knockdown, tau expression, τ expression, Impairment, neurotoxic, Alzheimer's disease model, AD model, alzheimer model, tau interaction, τ interaction, aging population, aged population, population aging, overexpression, overexpress, screening, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, healthspan, health-span, RNA metabolism,</keyword><description>Control of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major hub for regulation in the brain. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there is a strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in which Tau protein and Aß42
fragments have been shown to interact and/or modulate directly or indirectly RNA binding proteins and RNA
metabolism in general. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Interestingly, circRNAs accumulate in an age-dependent manner in neural tissues suggesting
their relevance to age-related homeostasis and/or pathogenesis. Indeed, specific circRNAs accumulate in
the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. However, how these circRNAs are
involved in the pathogenesis of those and other neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown.
We recently developed systems to down- or up-regulate circRNAs in Drosophila. Using these tools, we
demonstrated the functionality of these molecules in vivo. We generated a resource to knock down (KD) the
110 more abundant circRNAs and found that KD of particular circRNAs results in different brain-related
phenotypes. Interestingly, we identified 35 circRNAs that when knocked down alter lifespan. Further data
shows that expression of some circRNAs is toxic for the aging fly, with links to aging and potentially
neurodegeneration. In addition, we found that KD of some circRNAs lead to specific behavioral and motor
defects, many of which are age-dependent. In addition, we observed changes in the levels of circRNAs in
Drosophila models of AD or other neurogenerative diseases. Here we aim to uncover the functions and
mechanisms of action of circRNAs during AD. To do so, we will use Drosophila AD models and perform a
genomic screening to determine if modulation of individual circRNAs can alter the progression and outcome
of the disease. Moreover, we will also test potential mechanisms by which circRNAs could alter AD including
nucleation of aggregates, altering mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, and/or inflammation.
In sum, the present proposal will reveal new roles of circRNAs during AD. As we will perform the
experiments in a system that has high and functional levels of circRNAs (the fly CNS) the present results will
be meaningful and could be later extended to mammalian models. We are aware of the limitations of the AD
fly models but this is the only system in which the full extent of interaction with a large number of circRNAs
can be assessed. Moreover, as we have already found that some circRNAs alter aging, the chances of
success are high. This will be a pioneering work in this new and important area of research and we are
confident that our findings will open a new pathway for studying the roles of circRNAs in AD. Our project
builds on exciting preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise of our group.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KADENER, SEBASTIAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>S10OD034395</grantId><grantName>A 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>482094.0</amount><startDate>2023-04-01</startDate><endDate>2024-03-31</endDate><keyword>Aging, Air, Biological Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Grant, Minor, United States National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Institutes of Health, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Running, Temperature, Walking, Ensure, Funding, instrument, Nuclear, NMR Spectroscopy, NMR Spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Manufacturer, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments,</keyword><description>Project Summary
We are requesting funds to purchase a new Bruker Avance Neo 400 MHz spectrometer with

in many cases repeat rhythmically. Rhythmic changes in gene expression have been studied
in the brain only in the context of circadian rhythms. Additionally, shorter-than-a-day (ultradian)
rhythms have been sparsely reported and it is unknown how these rhythms originate,
particularly at the molecular level and whether they interact and/or share part of the
timekeeping machinery utilized by the circadian clock. Understanding how these rhythms are
generated and maintained will illuminate new aspects of brain gene expression and physiology
and open unexplored areas of research.
In an effort to reveal RNA oscillations at different timescales in the fly brain, we profiled fly brains
by RNAseq every two hours for three days. By analyzing these data, we identified dozens of
RNAs oscillating with 6-, 12-, and 24-hour rhythms in the brain. Interestingly, enrichment
analysis shows that more than half of these genes are highly expressed in the glia, suggesting
this cell type has oscillators operating at different timescales. The importance and novelty
of these results are two-fold: a. they demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of ultradian
RNA oscillations in the fly brain; b. suggest the existence of oscillators operating at
different timescales (circadian and ultradian) in the glial cells. In this context, the present
proposal aims to comprehensively identify the mechanisms responsible for ultradian
rhythmic gene expression in the glial cells within the fly brain. Our work will shed light on
new mechanisms of ultradian expression in flies for the first time. In addition, we will identify
and characterize new timekeeping or timer-like mechanisms operating in glial cells that also
have a circadian clock. Last, our work will provide new information and lead to developing tools
to perturb and investigate these rhythms in the future.
In sum, we are convinced that this project will uncover new modes of timed regulation of
transcription and physiology within the brain, which might be of vast importance beyond
Drosophila and uncover potential connections between ultradian and circadian oscillators
within these cells. This pioneering study will set the stage for further studying the role of
oscillations in the glia, a key cell type in the brain, as well as to understand the mechanism and
role of ultradian rhythms in general. As circadian rhythms have been linked to numerous diseases
including depression and sleep disorders, the present proposal has obvious implications for
human health.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KADENER, SEBASTIAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AI174956</grantId><grantName>Mannosidase-stabilized glycan immunogens for elicitation of high mannose patch antibodies</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>243750.0</amount><startDate>2023-04-01</startDate><endDate>2025-03-31</endDate><keyword>Antibodies, Antigenic Determinants, Binding Determinants, Epitopes, immunogen, Antigens, Carbohydrates, Transport Protein Gene, Transport Proteins, Transporter Protein, Carrier Proteins, Disaccharides, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, ELISA, enzyme linked immunoassay, Family, Glycoconjugates, Glycopeptides, glycosylation, Metabolic Glycosylation, Goals, HIV, AIDS Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, LAV-HTLV-III, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus, Virus-HIV, HIV Antibodies, HIV-Associated Antibodies, HTLV-III Antibodies, HTLV-III-LAV Antibodies, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Antibodies, LAV Antibodies, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120, HIV env Protein gp120, HTLV-III gp120, gp120, gp120 ENV Glycoprotein, gp120(HIV), HIV Infections, HTLV-III Infections, HTLV-III-LAV Infections, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections, Immunization, Immunologic Sensitization, Immunologic Stimulation, Immunological Sensitization, Immunological Stimulation, Immunostimulation, Infection, Laboratories, Macaca mulatta, M mulatta, M. mulatta, Rhesus Macaque, Rhesus Monkey, Mannose, D-Mannose, Mannopyranose, Mannopyranoside, Mannosidase, Methods, Oxygen, O element, O2 element, Patients, Peptides, Polysaccharides, Glycans, Proteins, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Domestic Rabbit, Rabbits, Rabbits Mammals, S element, Sulfur, Testing, Vaccination, Vaccines, Virus, cross reacting material 197, CRM-197, CRM197, Family member, improved, Surface, Variation, Variant, Single Crystal Diffraction, X Ray Crystallographies, X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography, X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography, Xray Crystallography, X-Ray Crystallography, Blood Serum, Serum, analog, Collaborations, Germinal Center, Structure of germinal center of lymph node, neutralizing antibody, Hydrophobicity, Structure, Memory B-Lymphocyte, Memory B Cell, response, Binding, Molecular Interaction, mannosyl(9)-N-acetylglucosamine2, Man9GlcNAc2, prevent, preventing, Length, Affinity, gp-120 Antigen, gp-120, in vivo, V3 Loop, V3 Loop of HIV-1, Modification, immunogenicity, man, arm, Antibody Response, Immunize,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) most commonly target the High Mannose Patch (HMP), a
mannose-rich region of HIV Env in the vicinity of the V3 loop and the N332 glycan. HMP bnAbs (e.g.,
2G12, PGT128, BG18) tend to recognize non-reducing-terminal Man1α-2Man moieties within
oligomannose glycans; however, in immunizations with oligomannose glycoconjugates, antibodies are
rarely raised against Man1a-2Man, and instead bind to core motifs of the glycan. We hypothesize that in
vivo mannosidase trimming of Man1a-2Man termini is a major reason why antibodies do not develop
against this motif. In Aim 1, we will prepare stabilized oligomannose glycans, in which a sulfur linkage
prevents mannosidase cleavage of the Man1α-2Man, but structurally mimics the natural glycan and is
recognized by bnAbs. In Aim 2, we will immunize rabbits with CRM197 glycoconjugates containing the
stabilized or unstabilized glycans and compare the resulting antibodies’ HIV Env binding and
neutralization activity. We will also intensively characterize the ability of these antibodies to bind Man1a-
2Man using an oligomannose-focused glycan array.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2316281</grantId><grantName>URoL:  Epigenetics 2: Robustness and Adaptability of the Dynamic Epigenome: A Multiscale Approach</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>1204512.0</amount><startDate>2022-10-01</startDate><endDate>2024-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Ragunathan, Kaushik</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>S10OD034223</grantId><grantName>Abberior 3D-STED microscope for super-resolution imaging</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1235585.0</amount><startDate>2023-03-01</startDate><endDate>2024-02-29</endDate><keyword>Aging, Biology, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, Cell Body, Cells, Communities, Disease, Disorder, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptogenic, Faculty, Health, Human, Modern Man, Learning, Memory, Microscopy, Molecular Structure, Macromolecular Structure, United States National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Institutes of Health, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Optics, optical, Organelles, Organism, living system, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Science, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Technology, Body Tissues, Tissues, Universities, bases, base, Microscope, improved, Image Analyses, image evaluation, image interpretation, Image Analysis, Area, Confocal Microscopy, Cell Components, Cell Structure, Cellular Structures, Funding, Biological Function, Biological Process, instrument, fighting, nano meter, nanometer, System, 3-D, 3D, three dimensional, 3-Dimensional, interest, Structure, Sampling, Institution, prevent, preventing, Core Facility, Data, Resolution, resolutions, in vivo, Cancer Biology, Preparation, preparations, Image, imaging, molecular scale, nanoscale, nano meter scale, nano meter sized, nano scale, nanometer scale, nanometer sized, novel therapeutics, new drug treatments, new drugs, new therapeutics, new therapy, next generation therapeutics, novel drug treatments, novel drugs, novel therapy, quantitative imaging, imaging system, subcellular targeting, sub-cellular targeting, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, therapeutic nanoparticles, confocal imaging, superresolution imaging,</keyword><description>We are requesting funds to purchase an Abberior Instruments FACILITY line 3D STED microscope to be
maintained in the Brandeis University Confocal Imaging Core Facility. This microscope will serve a primary user
group of 10 NIH funded investigators, and two junior faculty who will be applying for NIH funding, and we
welcome additional users from the biomedical sciences at Brandeis and the region. Our groups pursue a wide
variety of projects relevant to human health including aging, cancer biology, neurodegeneration, epilepsy,
learning and memory, and the origins of multicellular organisms. A common feature of these diverse studies is
a deep reliance on optical microscopy and an overarching interest in understanding how molecular-scale
structures (tens of nanometers in size) control cell and tissue-scale biological processes. A major barrier to our
progress in these areas is the lack of an imaging system at our institution that can resolve these tiny structures
of interest. Among the many strategies to overcome this resolution barrier (such as STORM, SOFI, and
expansion microscopy), a STED microscope is the ideal solution for our research community: It is fundamentally
a confocal microscope, and our user base has exceptionally broad and deep expertise in all aspects of confocal
microscopy including sample preparation, imaging, and rigorous quantitative image analysis. A STED
microscope would represent a five-fold improvement in resolution over our current capabilities and would open
up avenues of biology that are completely invisible to us now. Data collected on the instrument will help answer
many open questions: How do novel therapeutic nanoparticles target subcellular organelles to fight cancer? How
do signal sending and receiving structures at neuronal synapses assemble together to control learning and
memory or prevent epilepsy? How do molecules important to aging and neurodegeneration localize and function
at these synapses? Because of the small size of each of these structures, these are questions we cannot answer
with our current technology. Beyond the increase in resolution this system provides, it is equipped with features
that facilitate deep volumetric imaging and live imaging, which will allow us to perform experiments in vivo in
living tissues. Together, the Abberior STED system would profoundly improve our ability to discover how
nanoscale molecular and cellular structures control cell and tissue biology that is relevant to human health and
disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RODAL, AVITAL ADAH</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>80NSSC23K0345</grantId><grantName>E014042 - HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS OF GEOSTROPHIC TURBULENCE AND INTERNAL WAVES</grantName><funderCode>80</funderCode><funderAgency>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</funderAgency><amount>252110.0</amount><startDate>2023-01-01</startDate><endDate>2025-12-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01HD111038</grantId><grantName>Addressing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Disparities and Barriers among Adolescents and Young Adults with Disabilities</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>858446.0</amount><startDate>2023-02-10</startDate><endDate>2028-01-31</endDate><keyword>Patients, Research, Resources, Research Resources, Risk, Survey Instrument, Surveys, Target Populations, Testing, United States, Woman, Writing, Gender, Caregivers, Care Givers, Healthcare, health care, Population Heterogeneity, diverse populations, heterogeneous population, population diversity, Youth, Youth 10-21, Caring, improved, Clinical, disability, Health Care Utilization, health care service use, healthcare service use, healthcare service utilization, healthcare utilization, health care service utilization, adult youth, young adulthood, young adult, sexually active, Reproductive Health, Collaborations, tool, Multimedium, Multimedia, Knowledge, Dimensions, Intellectual disability, Intellectual limitation, intellectual and developmental disability, limited intellectual functioning, Intellectual functioning disability, health knowledge, Services, preference, experience, peer, member, Sampling, response, Intervention, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, Reproductive Health Services, Provider, Address, Sexual Health, Consent, Data, Educational Materials, Teenagers, Teen, teen years, teenage, Development, developmental, Outcome, Population, aged, innovation, innovate, innovative, service utilization, evidence base, population based, efficacy testing, young man, adolescent man, adolescent men, young woman, adolescent woman, adolescent women, Adolescent and Young Adult, health care disparity, disparate health care, disparate healthcare, disparity in care, disparity in healthcare, health care inequality, health care inequity, healthcare disparity, healthcare inequality, healthcare inequity, health care service, healthcare service, health service use, health service utilization, women with disabilities, disabled women, patient-clinician communication, patient-doctor communication, patient-provider communication, care outcomes, health care outcomes, healthcare outcomes, pilot test, 12-20 years old, adolescence (12-20), Adolescence, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, ages, Age, Appointment, Child Development Disorders, Developmental Disabilities, Clinical Trials, Communication, Curriculum, lesson plans, Educational Curriculum, Education, Educational aspects, Family, Female, Foundations, Future, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Disabled Persons, Disabled Population, Handicapped, People with Disabilities, Persons with Disabilities, disabled, disabled individual, disabled people, individuals with disabilities, Health, Health education, Health Instruction, Health Tutoring, Health Priorities, Health Resources, Health Services, Interview, Literature, male, Methods, Persons, United States National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Institutes of Health, Parents, parent,</keyword><description>Studies to date suggest that the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care needs of adolescents and young
adults (AYA) with disabilities are not well met, despite the fact that this population is as likely to be sexually
active as their peers without disabilities. However, research on SRH and receipt of SRH-related health care
among AYA with disabilities remains limited. Scant evidence informs our understanding of the reproductive
healthcare needs of both young women and men with disabilities by disability type and there is no research on
reproductive healthcare service utilization across the breadth of this diverse population. Further, there are few
resources to help AYA with disabilities navigate barriers to SRH care and obtain needed services. This mixed-
methods study will examine SRH and healthcare utilization and SRH-related unmet needs among transition
age adolescents and young adults with disabilities overall and by disability type in the United States. We will
triangulate information from national survey data, interviews with AYA with disabilities, and interviews with
parents of AYA with disabilities. Our analyses will address three fundamental questions that will establish a
foundation for development and pilot testing of a tailored intervention to improve SRH care and outcomes for
AYA with disabilities, ages 15-26: 1) What disparities exist in reproductive health care service utilization by
gender and type of disability; 2) What are the barriers to SRH care for AYA with disabilities and how are these
similar or different by gender and disability type?; and 3) What SRH information and resources would enhance
knowledge, participation in care, and communication with providers for AYA with disabilities? Building on this
foundation, we will collaborate with AYA with disabilities to develop an intervention to address the identified
barriers and unmet needs. Our project directly addresses unmet needs for SRH care identified by the National
Institutes of Health, including (1) investigating barriers to reproductive health care for AYA with disabilities, and
(2) developing reproductive health education materials for use by AYA with disabilities. This project builds on
the research team’s prior research on reproductive health of teens and women with disabilities, experience in
developing health education curricula and sexual health resources for people with developmental disabilities,
and clinical expertise in provision of care to people with disabilities transitioning from adolescence to
adulthood. The expected outcome of this project is an innovative, accessible, multi-media educational toolkit to
improve SRH knowledge and activation and provider communication. Our pilot testing will provide initial
evidence on the utility of the toolkit for our target population, establishing a foundation for future efficacy testing
in a clinical trial. This project will break new ground by providing a foundation of evidence on SRH health and
healthcare outcomes, and will develop an innovative SRH educational toolkit to address barriers and
disparities among AYA with disabilities.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MITRA, MONIKA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>FA95502310072</grantId><grantName>A

Transcription dominates the gene expression landscape of circadian rhythms and a number of neuroscience
areas. Yet post-transcriptional regulation, including translational regulation and the role of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), has become increasingly recognized as important in recent years. Moreover, understanding
the roles of RBPs in diverse cell types and diseases and ultimately therapeutic intervention requires identifying
the RNA targets of RBPs. The ribosome can be considered a RBP, so this focus on post-transcriptional
regulation and RBP targets includes identifying ribosome-associated transcripts, namely RNAs that change
their translational status under defined circumstances. RBP identification is particularly challenging from small
numbers of cells, e.g., cancer stem cells within a large, heterogeneous solid tumor or discrete neuronal
subtypes. These settings preclude traditional biochemistry and therefore require new approaches. Two new
methods recently appeared, TRIBE and STAMP, which exploit the RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC,
respectively. Their ribosome versions, Ribo-STAMP and Ribo-TRIBE, are even more recent and fuse a
ribosomal protein to the editing enzymes. This is so that the enzyme will be near RNAs that are being
translated and will “mark” them by changing their sequence. These edits are identified by mRNA sequencing
and straightforward computational methods, even from single cells. We propose to compare Ribo-STAMP and
Ribo-TRIBE side-by-side in mammalian cell culture systems, to assess their efficacy and to determine the
optimal configuration of ribosome-editing enzyme fusions. We also propose to develop Ribo-TRIBE for use in
Drosophila; we recently discovered that STAMP does not work in this organism, which limits us to TRIBE. We
will then extend these methods to the more biological context of neurons, from Drosophila as well as from
mouse brains. To complement these efforts, we will develop an extension of the TRIBE/STAMP theme called
Nanobody-editing. It consists of fusing the editing enzyme, ADAR or APOBEC, to a GFP-nanobody, which will
then deliver the editing enzyme to any GFP-tagged RNA binding protein or GFP-tagged ribosome. The
chimeric, recombinant protein will be used in vitro as a recombinant protein or expressed in vivo. Nanobody-
editing will facilitate identifying RBP and ribosome targets, because already existing GFP-tagged RBP or
ribosomes can serve as substrates. Moreover, in vitro editing will in many cases obviate the need to generate
new transgenes and transgenic animals. Lastly, TRIBE and as well as Ribo-TRIBE will be used to characterize
translational regulation “around the clock” within a few key Drosophila circadian neurons. These efforts will
deepen our understanding of circadian gene expression regulation as well as provide the community with new
tools with which to study translation in important but challenging biological systems.</description><investigator><investigatorId>ROSBASH, MICHAEL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2228681</grantId><grantName>Collaborative Research: Statistical mechanics of dense suspensions - dynamical correlations and scaling theory</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>269703.0</amount><startDate>2023-02-01</startDate><endDate>2026-01-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Chakraborty, Bulbul</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R00GM136915</grantId><grantName>Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>248999.0</amount><startDate>2020-09-15</startDate><endDate>2025-12-31</endDate><keyword>Birth Defects, Congenital Anatomic Abnormality, Congenital Anatomical Abnormality, Congenital Defects, Congenital Deformity, Congenital Malformation, Congenital Abnormality, Actomyosin, Affect, Algorithms, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, Behavior, biophysical foundation, biophysical principles, biophysical sciences, Biophysics, Cell Interaction, Cell-to-Cell Interaction, Cell Communication, cell culture, cell cultures, Cell Culture Techniques, Cell Body, Cells, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Cytoskeleton, Developmental Biology, Disease, Disorder, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Embryo, Embryonic, Engineering, Exhibits, Heterogeneity, In Vitro, Light, Photoradiation, Morphogenesis, morphogenetic process, Motion, Movement, body movement, Myosin ATPase, Actin-Activated ATPase, Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase, Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase, Myosins, Neural Tube Defects, Neural Tube Developmental Defects, Noise, Organism, living system, Proteins, Testing, Time, Body Tissues, Tissues, Transportation, Work, Generations, congenital cardiac abnormality, congenital cardiac disease, congenital cardiac disorder, congenital cardiac malformation, congenital heart abnormality, congenital heart anomaly, congenital heart disease, congenital heart malformation, congenital heart disorder, Cell Size, Link, Ensure, Congenital Disorders, Galaxy, Genetic, Morphology, Shapes, machine learned, Machine Learning, programs, mechanic, mechanical, Mechanics, cell biology, Cellular biology, Adopted, Pattern, Techniques, Location, fetal, Early Diagnosis, early detection, computer science, Structure, novel, Regulation, Pathway Analysis, Network Analysis, Property, theories, Address, Data, Reproducibility, in vivo, transmission process, Transmission, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, fly, Flies, Image, imaging, Population, malformation, interdisciplinary approach, multidisciplinary approach, fetal medicine, constriction, optogenetics, mechanical properties, mechanical force, Maternal-fetal medicine, confocal imaging, tissue-level behavior, mechanical stimulus,</keyword><description> It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even
under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and
regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures
reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting
cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the
correct final shape.
 One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical
connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that
link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular
protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise
filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in
confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire
tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to
identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically
ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.
 This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change
highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their
patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level,
where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface
of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly
interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell
level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic
robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular
networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As
well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and
control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and
fetal medicine.</description><investigator><investigatorId>DUCLOS YEVICK, HANNAH GABRIELLE</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2244769</grantId><grantName>I-Corps: Searchable, Extendible Data Archive for Neuroscience and Physiology Research</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>50000.0</amount><startDate>2022-11-15</startDate><endDate>2023-10-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Van Hooser, Stephen</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AI174516</grantId><grantName>A Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 system for conditional gene disruption in Aedes aegypti</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>243750.0</amount><startDate>2022-11-14</startDate><endDate>2024-10-31</endDate><keyword>Acceleration, Aedes, Animals, Arboviral, Arthropod-Borne Viruses, Arboviruses, Behavior, Biology, Breeding, necrocytosis, Cell Death, Cell Body, Cells, chikungunya, Dengue, Disease, Disorder, Disease Vectors, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Embryo, Embryonic, Genes, Goals, Health, Human, Modern Man, Insecta, Insects, Insects Invertebrates, Methods, Culicidae, Mosquitoes, Persons, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Afferent Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Physiology, Production, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Transfer RNA, Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor, tRNA, transfer Ribonucleic acids, Specificity, Testing, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Virus, Work, Yellow Fever, Guide RNA, gRNA, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, promoter, promotor, improved, Left, Specified, Specific qualifier value, Medical, insight, Gene Targeting, Biological Function, Biological Process, Transgenes, Genetic, gene function, tool, Adopted, Investigation, Source, System, Mosquito-borne disease, Mosquito-borne infectious disease, interest, cytotoxicity, Lytotoxicity, experience, mutant, Gene Silencing, Gene Inactivation, transcriptional silencing, Essential Genes, Transgenic Organisms, transgenic, Speed, Basic Science, Basic Research, neural circuit, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, genetic technology, theories, Address, Modification, Development, developmental, vector mosquito, vector control, vector, design, designing, Population, loss of function, overexpression, overexpress, genetic approach, genetic strategy, Genetic study, genome editing, genomic editing, CRISPR/Cas technology, CRISPR approach, CRISPR based approach, CRISPR method, CRISPR methodology, CRISPR technique, CRISPR technology, CRISPR tools, CRISPR-CAS-9, CRISPR-based method, CRISPR-based technique, CRISPR-based technology, CRISPR-based tool, CRISPR/CAS approach, CRISPR/Cas method, CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, Cas nuclease technology, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats approach, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology, Knock-in, knockin, Injections, ZIKA,</keyword><description>Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing
hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the
viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.
aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.
aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vector’s development, physiology and
behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.
Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.
 To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to
create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely
valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To
address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.
aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,
allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti
In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9
transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes
that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes
that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.
Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally
In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-
specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct
mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>DESC0023181</grantId><grantName>STRESS TESTING THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS AT THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER</grantName><funderCode>89</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Energy</funderAgency><amount>125000.0</amount><startDate>2022-06-01</startDate><endDate>2023-05-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90RTCP0006</grantId><grantName>COMMUNITY LIVING EQUITY CENTER - THE COMMUNITY LIVING EQUITY CENTER (CLEC), HOUSED AT THE LURIE INSTITUTE FOR DISABILITY POLICY AT BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING COMMUNITY LIVING DISPARITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER INTERSECTING IDENTITIES.

foundational cognitive capability. While many brain regions interact to enable cognitive processes of learning
and decision making, the subiculum and hippocampus of the medial temporal lobe are central nodes in the
underlying neural circuit. Accordingly, medial temporal lobe dysfunction is a hallmark of psychiatric disorders
such as depression, PTSD and other anxiety disorders, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding basic
neural function and coordination processes in the subiculum and hippocampus during memory and decision
making will therefore be crucial in the progress towards effective interventions for these disorders; however,
subiculum function and its coordination with hippocampus during these cognitive tasks is almost completely
unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that subiculum links individual memories formed by the
hippocampus and thereby enables cognitive capabilities such as abstraction, categorization, and deliberation
during decision making. During the mentored phase (K99), high-density in vivo electrophysiology will be used in
rats to observe subiculum and hippocampal subregion CA1 activity during a navigational memory-guided
decision making task. Optogenetic interruption of the proposed coordination mechanism between subiculum and
CA1 during behavior will then provide evidence to its necessity for memory-guided decision making. Theoretical
models will assess plausible mechanisms underlying the formation of subiculum activity patterns. Experiments
during the independent (R00) phase will extend this approach through the dorsal-ventral extent of CA1 and
subiculum and to emotional aspects of memory such as hedonic value. Successful completion of this proposal
has the potential to result in two significant conceptual breakthroughs: 1) subiculum is a major and critical
component of hippocampal output with specific and distinct functions during memory-guided decision making,
2) subiculum and CA1 function and encoding properties are consistent throughout their dorsal-ventral extents
and are best understood under a single conceptual framework. This research plan will be executed by Dr. Jacob
Olson under the guidance of Dr. Shantanu Jadhav and Dr. Donald Katz, facilitated by the collaborative,
innovative, and rigorous nature of the Neuroscience Program and Department of Psychology at Brandeis
University. This proposal also contains a comprehensive training and development plan with emphases on
cutting-edge recoding and manipulation techniques, theoretical modeling, and scholarly development to fully
prepare Dr. Olson to lead an innovative and impactful research program studying the mechanisms of neural
coordination underlying memory-guided decision making as an independent investigator.</description><investigator><investigatorId>OLSON, JACOB

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small nucleus in the brainstem that is vulnerable to the accumulation of abnormal
tau protein, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The LC is structurally connected to the
temporal lobe and may play a role in transmitting abnormal tau through trans-neuronal spread. The LC is the
primary producer of the neuromodulator norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is essential for normal attention and
memory function. Beyond a role in cognition, norepinephrine serves a myriad of neuroprotective roles which
include inhibition of oxidative stress, maintenance of the blood brain barrier, and anti-inflammatory processes.
The occurrence of hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC has been linked with loss of norepinephrine-producing
LC neurons. The targeting and neurodegeneration of LC is particularly insidious due to the combined loss of
cognition-enhancing neuromodulation and loss of neuroprotective functions thus paving the way for disease
acceleration and propagation. Despite insults to the LC, there is evidence for upregulation of norepinephrine
metabolism in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. We propose upregulation of norepinephrine
synthesis in the LC cells remaining represents a mechanism of neurochemical compensation that, in some
individuals, wards off cognitive decline and protects against disease spread. In healthy older adult humans, we
will define relationships between LC structural integrity, and norepinephrine synthesis levels (Aim 1). We will
determine the extent to which elevated norepinephrine synthesis confers a benefit to memory performance
(Aim 2). Finally, we will test the hypothesis that elevated norepinephrine synthesis is associated with reduced
tau accumulation longitudinally (Aim 3). This multimodal study will combine state-of-the-art magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to measure LC structural integrity, [18F]Fluoro-m-tyrosine positron emission
tomography (PET) to measure norepinephrine/dopamine synthesis capacity, [18F]MK-6240 PET to measure
tau pathology, and plasma measures of Ab42/40. If successful, this research will provide new understanding of
the neurochemical basis of individual differences in disease progression and will launch a novel avenue of
investigation into the role of norepinephrine in disease resilience (supporting maintenance of cognitive function
despite pathology) and disease resistance (combatting disease spread).</description><investigator><investigatorId>BERRY, ANNE SHIVELY</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>80NSSC22K0758</grantId><grantName>VIBROTACTILE FEEDBACK AS A COUNTERMEASURE FOR SPATIAL DISORIENTATION DURING A STABILIZATION TASK IN A SPACEFLIGHT ANALOG CONDITION</grantName><funderCode>80</funderCode><funderAgency>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</funderAgency><amount>90000.0</amount><startDate>2022-03-08</startDate><endDate>2024-03-07</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2205457</grantId><grantName>Collaborative Research: Revealing the Interactions and Dynamics in Framework-Polymer Composite Materials</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>123555.0</amount><startDate>2022-06-15</startDate><endDate>2025-05-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Schmidt-Rohr, Klaus</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM139798</grantId><grantName>Predoctoral Training in Cross-disciplinary Molecular and Cellular Biology</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1261076.0</amount><startDate>2021-07-01</startDate><endDate>2026-06-30</endDate><keyword>Training, Molecular and Cellular Biology, pre-doctoral, pre-doc, predoc, predoctoral,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
The goals of this training program entitled “Predoctoral Training in Cross-disciplinary Molecular and Cellular
Biology” (CMCB) at Brandeis University are to produce rigorous, quantitative scientists with expertise in multiple
disciplines, to provide trainees with the skills needed to succeed in diverse science-related careers, and to help
trainees explore and pursue their career interests in an informed manner. This new program combines the
complementary strengths of two prior Brandeis T32 programs: “Genetic and Biochemical Mechanisms of
Regulation, T32GM007122”, expiring after &gt;40 years of NIGMS support, and “Quantitative Biology,
T32EB009419”, expiring after 10 years of NIBIB support. While both training programs had strong track
records of student research productivity and career outcomes, we significantly rethought and revised core
elements of training (based on student and faculty feedback) to better prepare students for a future in which
interdisciplinary research is increasingly crucial. Innovations include: (1) increased quantitative training,
through courses and an annual workshop, (2) revising the timing and goal of the qualifying exam, both to
improve the training value and to better serve students from diverse scientific and personal backgrounds, (3)
earlier implementation of Individual Development Plans and Thesis Committee Meetings to accelerate trainee
career development and research progress, (4) introducing a secondary research advisor in a complementary
discipline to facilitate interdisciplinary training, (5) a two week professional Externship in Year 4+, (6) new
program self-assessment mechanisms, including semi-annual trainee feedback and the creation of an External
Advisory Committee, and (7) formal training in and oversight of mentoring for all training faculty. Trainee
appointments will be made at the end of Year 1, after students have completed one year of coursework, four 9-
week laboratory rotations, and chosen a lab. In Year 2, trainees serve as teaching assistants for one course per
semester, take a Proseminar course to help them craft their thesis research plan and defend it at their qualifying
exam (end of Year 2), and to develop a career Individual Development Plan (IDP). In Year 3+, trainees take a
final elective and focus on their research. They present their work at annual Departmental talks, have annual
Thesis Committee Meetings focused on career planning and research progress. In Year 4+, they engage in a
two-week career Externship and serve as mentors at the annual Quantitative Analysis workshop. Program
outcomes and success will be measured by: (1) sustained research impact (reflected in trainee publications),
(2) development of independent scientific thinking and communication (assessed through thesis proposals,
annual Departmental talks and Thesis Committee Meetings), (3) active trainee engagement in their own career
development (reflected in annual IDPs, discussions at Thesis Committee Meetings, and the new Externship
program), and (4) trainee placement and long-term success in science-related careers. There are 29 CMCB
training faculty, and 12 slots are requested (~6 trainees/year, with trainees supported in Years 2 and 3).</description><investigator><investigatorId>GOODE, BRUCE L</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DC019863</grantId><grantName>The contribution of lateral hypothalamus to cortical palatability coding and behavior</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>66463.0</amount><startDate>2022-05-16</startDate><endDate>2025-05-15</endDate><keyword>Animals, driving, Automobile Driving, Axon, Dorsum, Back, Behavior, Cell Body, Cells, Communication, Cues, Decision Making, Deglutition, Swallowing, Disease, Disorder, Electrodes, Electromyography, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Environment, Feeding behaviors, Ingestive Behavior, feeding-related behaviors, nutrient intake activity, Food, Genetic Techniques, Genetic Technics, Health, Human, Modern Man, Hypothalamic structure, Hypothalamus, hypothalamic, Jaw, Mentorship, Muscle, Muscle Tissue, muscular, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Obesity, adiposity, corpulence, Occupations, Jobs, Professional Positions, Population Dynamics, Production, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Specificity, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Taste Perception, Testing, Time, Toxin, Work, Measures, Technical Expertise, technical skills, Prosencephalon, Fore-Brain, Forebrain, improved, Lateral, Site, Training, Buccal Cavity, Buccal Cavity Head and Neck, Cavitas Oris, Mouth, Oral cavity, insight, Stimulus, awake, Knowledge, compulsive eating, compulsive feeding, compulsive overeating, Binge Eating, Complex, Dependence, In Situ, Sensory, Source, cell type, Techniques, interest, neural, novel, sensory system, Appearance, Code, Coding System, response, Intervention, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, hypocretin, Hcrt protein, Hcrt/ORX, Hcrts/ORXs, hypocretin/orexin, hypocretins/orexins, orexin, cell cortex, Feeds, Data, Interruption, in vivo, Computational Technique, Development, developmental, Behavioral, Pathway interactions, pathway, Output, feeding, Consumption, hedonic, Coupled, Coupling, optogenetics, genetic approach, genetic strategy, taste system, gustatory system, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, knowledgebase,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The central job of the taste system involves deciding whether a substance in the mouth should be swallowed or
rejected. This job is of unique importance, in that these decisions are necessarily made after a potentially toxic
stimulus is already internal. Primary gustatory cortex (GC) has proven vital for driving taste rejection behavior in
situ, but it is unlikely GC is acting alone to accomplish this task. Of particular interest as a possible functional
partner to GC is the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which has long been known to be centrally involved in feeding
behavior, and which contains neurons producing two distinct types of palatability-related taste responses. This
proposal describes work that will use multi-electrode electrophysiology, electromyography, pathway- and
neuron-specific optogenetics, and complex neural and behavioral analyses to investigate whether and how GC
and LH coordinate to drive consumption-related cortical firing and behavior. Dual-site electrophysiological
responses from awake, tasting rats will be analyzed to determine whether and how LH and GC responses are
coupled for production of palatability-related firing; further work will determine whether particular response types
or neurons (i.e., orexin+ neurons, known to drive consumption) contribute to any observed LH-GC coupling.
Perturbing LHGC input (and specifically the activity of orexin+ neurons) during tasting sessions will test whether
and how hypothalamic input impacts GC taste response dynamics. These experiments will be the first exploration
into GC-LH cooperation for taste processing and behavioral output. Over the course of this project, advanced
computational training will be acquired both in the classroom and through the development of novel scripts for
specific analyses. The collaborative and intimate environment within the lab and at Brandeis will nourish not only
the knowledgebase (computational and beyond), but the mentorship, communication, and technical skills
required to develop as an independent researcher. The combination of behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic
approaches will provide invaluable insight to the taste system, ultimately improving our knowledge of the
gustatory system and how taste processing and decisions are made. As we are directly investigating palatability
and its relationship to behavior this clears the path for future research on disorders related to consumption and

and play an important role in cell communication in the nervous system. Neuronal EVs mediate activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity, as well as the spread and clearance of toxic protein aggregates associated with
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. EV biogenesis and
secretion occurs via endosomal trafficking, but the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates these cell
biological processes have not been well characterized. By identifying activity-dependent mechanisms influencing
neuronal EV dynamics, we will gain greater insight into basic and pathological processes in the nervous system.
The majority of EV research utilizes in vitro non-neuronal cell models to isolate heterogenous EV populations,
making direct measurements of neuronal EV biogenesis and trafficking mechanisms challenging. The Drosophila
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) serves as a powerful in vivo model that is highly amenable to manipulating and
visualizing EV cargo. My preliminary findings in this system suggest that Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII), a key synaptic protein involved in structural and functional forms of synaptic plasticity, plays
a role in EV trafficking. Specifically, CaMKII null mutants showed significantly decreased levels of the EV cargo
Syt4 in both EV precursors in the presynaptic neuron and postsynaptically secreted EVs. Syt4 modulates NMJ
synaptic growth and neurotransmitter release in an activity-dependent manner, leading to my hypothesis that
CaMKII regulates Syt4 EV signaling to promote structural and functional plasticity. In Aim 1, I will ask if CaMKII
controls EV cargo levels in an endocytic trafficking pathway that we previously identified to mediate EV cargo
trafficking. In the second aim, I will elucidate the relationship between CaMKII and Syt4 and test if they act in a
shared pathway to promote structural and functional plasticity. In Aim 3, I will isolate the specific CaMKII
function(s) involved in EV cargo and trafficking regulation. These aims will provide training in advanced imaging,
quantitative image analysis, Drosophila genetics, and electrophysiology. The information obtained from this
project will provide new insight into how CaMKII regulates EV trafficking to facilitate synaptic plasticity, and
identify new activity-dependent mechanisms regulating EVs in the nervous system.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PESCOSOLIDO, MATTHEW F.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2155111</grantId><grantName>Asymptotic and Uniform Diophantine Approximation Via Flows on Homogeneous Spaces</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>395545.0</amount><startDate>2022-06-01</startDate><endDate>2025-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Kleinbock, Dmitry</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2154242</grantId><grantName>Bijective Combinatorics for Geometrical Structures</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>210000.0</amount><startDate>2022-06-01</startDate><endDate>2025-05-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Bernardi, Olivier</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AA029817</grantId><grantName>Advancing Recovery Pathways and Support Services for Alcohol Use Disorders among Black Men and Women</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1305089.0</amount><startDate>2022-03-15</startDate><endDate>2026-12-31</endDate><keyword>ages, Age, Alcohol Drinking, EtOH drinking, EtOH use, alcohol ingestion, alcohol intake, alcohol product use, alcohol use, alcoholic beverage consumption, alcoholic drink intake, ethanol consumption, ethanol drinking, ethanol ingestion, ethanol intake, ethanol product use, ethanol use, Alcohol consumption, ethanol use disorder, alcohol use disorder, Alcohol Chemical Class, Alcohols, Americas, Parturition, Birth, Black, Black race, Capital, Client, Communities, Cessation of life, Death, Diagnosis, Disease, Disorder, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Employment, Environment, Female, Future, Goals, Heterogeneity, Recording of previous events, History, histories, Health Insurance, health insurance plan, Life Expectancy, male, Maps, Methods, Michigan, Minority Groups, Minority People, Minority Population, Minority individual, Morbidity -

structural inequities and racism. Although Black Americans are slightly less likely to drink alcohol than the
general population, the rate of Black drinkers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is comparable, representing 1.5
million Black Americans with AUD. Blacks suffer more negative consequences due to alcohol use such as
illnesses, injuries, criminal-legal involvement, and social problems. Recovery is a dynamic process of behavior
change leading to stable improvements in functioning, purpose and well-being. NIAAA further highlights
recovery as remission from AUD symptoms as well as cessation of heavy drinking. Recovery support services
and recovery community organizations aim to build recovery capital. Yet, to date little effort has been made to
consider recovery within population groups rather than across groups. A “centering in the margins” approach
emphasizes the need to examine experiences of racialized and minoritized populations. This proposed study to
advance recovery pathways and support services for Black men and women heeds that call. It is directly
responsive to RFA-AA-21-001 in its emphasis on health disparities in AUD populations, intersecting with the
RFA goals to advance culturally-informed measures and interventions, increase access to AUD services, make
services more appealing, and evaluate evidence-based practices. We do this with a focus on Black men and
women in AUD recovery. We thus aim to iteratively use quantitative and qualitative methods to capture and
assess questions related to AUD recovery in a heterogenous Black population, in partnership with a Black-
majority recovery community organization in Detroit. Specifically: (1) Use qualitative methods with a Black
population to (a) define AUD recovery pathways; (b) assess and refine a measure of recovery domains (e.g.,
relationships, living environment); and (c) identify and map community indicators that may facilitate or interfere
with AUD recovery. (2) Use quantitative methods to describe and assess the provision of AUD recovery
support services provided by the recovery community organization in terms of matching to needs, stage of
recovery and other client and community characteristics, by race/ethnicity. (3) Conduct a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial that builds on Aims 1 and 2 with a Black AUD recovery population, compared to a
treatment as usual group with in-person recovery support services, to determine the effectiveness of an added
phone+digital recovery support service intervention (i.e., provision of smartphones and guidance/support for
online recovery activities). The proposed study will enable a deep understanding of what recovery means to
Black men and women, how it can be measured, and how we can advance recovery journeys of Black
Americans with AUD. The results will be meaningful to Black individuals themselves, providers who treat
Blacks who have AUD, and to researchers and policymakers who need to better understand the meaning and
needs of a heterogenous US population.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1889663-44-22</grantId><grantName>PURPOSE: TO SUPPORT AN EXHIBITION FEATURING THE WORK OF PAINTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER BARKLEY HENDRICKS PRESENTED AT THE ROSE ART MUSEUM.</grantName><funderCode>417</funderCode><funderAgency>National Endowment for the Arts</funderAgency><amount>30000.0</amount><startDate>2022-01-01</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS122970</grantId><grantName>Neurotransmitter Plasticity and Regulation of Behavior</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>812500.0</amount><startDate>2022-02-15</startDate><endDate>2027-01-31</endDate><keyword>21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, Arousal, Behavior, Biology, Cell Body, Cells, Dopamine, Hydroxytyramine, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Exhibits, Differentiated Gene, Glutamates, L-Glutamate, glutamatergic, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Human, Modern Man, Inbreeding, Learning, Locomotion, Mammals, Mammalia, Maps, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, neurochemistry, neurochemical, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Phenotype, Physiology, Reagent, Role, social role, Seizures, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Sleep, Stress, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, thoughts, Thinking, Time, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Work, Mediating, Photoperiod, Site, Specified, Specific qualifier value, Variation, Variant, Link, Chemicals, Failure, cardiac function, function of the heart, heart function, Memory Deficit, memory dysfunction, Memory impairment, insight, Individual, Genetic, Individual Adjustment, Life, programs, Adopted, Complex, Event, Side, System, neurotransmitter release, cholinergic, neural, novel, Regulation, response, MicroRNAs, Micro RNA, miRNA, miRNAs, Address, Functional Imaging, Physiologic Imaging, physiological imaging, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, fly, Flies, Pathway interactions, pathway, Population, Prevalence, transcriptome sequencing, RNA Seq, RNA sequencing, RNAseq, transcriptomic sequencing, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, recruit,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Neurons have classically been defined by the neurotransmitter they release. This “identity” has
been considered to be both singular (i.e. one transmitter) and immutable (i.e. genetically
hardwired). While the astonishing prevalence of cotransmission has changed thinking about the
singularity of neurotransmitter identity there has been considerably less appreciation of the
ability of neurons to exhibit plasticity in their expression. Recently, we discovered that the
microRNA miR-190 is a potent regulator of adult sleep. Spatial and temporal mapping of its site
of action demonstrates that it is required during pupation in a population of cells that transcribes
both cholinergic and glutamatergic genes but differentiates to become a small subset of the
adult glutamatergic neurons. This subset includes components of the core sleep homeostasis
circuit. We will test the hypothesis that a neurotransmitter plasticity event is critical to function of
the mature circuit and that it provides a novel mechanism for establishing, and potentially
modifying, the sleep set-point of the homeostatic machinery.
Aim 1 will determine the role of neurotransmitter plasticity in the control of adult sleep, with a
focus on understanding the circuit-level changes.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of neuronal activity in transmitter switching and homeostat
plasticity, with a focus on understanding the molecular events.
In this proposal, we bring the power of Drosophila genetics to bear on this novel and important
type of plasticity. We demonstrate that programmed transmitter plasticity during pupal life is
crucial to adult function of the sleep circuitry. The genetic reagents we have developed will allow
us to address basic mechanisms underlying transmitter plasticity in the context of both the
developing and mature nervous systems and, for the first time, link this type of plasticity to
sleep.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2142887</grantId><grantName>CAREER: Optically-Controlled Phase Transition of Organic Molecules via Molecular Switching</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>262655.0</amount><startDate>2022-04-01</startDate><endDate>2027-03-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Han, Grace</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2151796</grantId><grantName>EAGER: Repair and Recombination of Mitochondrial DNA</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>299944.0</amount><startDate>2021-11-01</startDate><endDate>2023-10-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Haber, James</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90DPCP0012</grantId><grantName>PARENTS EMPOWERING PARENTS: NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER FOR PARENTS WITH DISABILITIES</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Administration for Community Living</funderAgency><amount>1000000.0</amount><startDate>2021-09-14</startDate><endDate>2026-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AA029821</grantId><grantName>Alcohol treatment in Medicaid managed care plans: Disparities in policies and outcomes</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1761975.0</amount><startDate>2021-09-20</startDate><endDate>2026-05-31</endDate><keyword>Alcohol Drinking, EtOH drinking, EtOH use, alcohol ingestion, alcohol intake, alcohol product use, alcohol use, alcoholic beverage consumption, alcoholic drink intake, ethanol consumption, ethanol drinking, ethanol ingestion, ethanol intake, ethanol product use, ethanol use, Alcohol consumption, ethanol use disorder, alcohol use disorder, Alcohol Chemical Class, Alcohols, Behavior Conditioning Therapy, Behavior Modification, Behavior Treatment, Behavioral Conditioning Therapy, Behavioral Modification, Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Treatment, Conditioning Therapy, behavior intervention, behavioral intervention, Behavior Therapy, Decision Making, District of Columbia, D.C.

minorities and women and in rural areas. Almost 90,000 Americans die annually from alcohol use. Despite the
health consequences, fewer than 10% of those with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive evidence-based
treatment, and racial/ethnic minorities and women are less likely to access treatment. Barriers to treatment
include stigma, treatment setting appeal, and health insurance benefit design. Medicaid programs are among
the most important payers for AUD treatment and rates of AUD in the Medicaid population are especially high.
Medicaid provides health insurance for more than 77 million Americans, including a large and disproportionate
share of racial/ethnic minorities, women, and rural Americans. Almost all state Medicaid programs contract with
Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs) to deliver and manage health care services and nearly 70%
of Medicaid enrollees are now in managed care. MMCOs must adhere to state requirements and policies, but
have considerable discretion over polices that may influence access, treatment appeal, and cost. However,
there is almost no information or transparency on MMCO polices related to alcohol treatment services. This
study systematically examines AUD treatment policies in MMCOs, an under-explored level where important
decisions are made that influence access and outcomes. We will conduct a national survey of MMCOs and link
their responses to patient-level Medicaid data. The specific aims are: 1) Examine Medicaid MMCO alcohol
treatment policies (e.g. coverage, utilization management, provider networks, innovations) across MMCOs that
contract with the 50 states and District of Columbia; determine whether there are differences in MMCO alcohol
treatment policies by state Medicaid policies. 2) Assess the relationship between MMCO policies and access to
AUD treatment (e.g. initiation and engagement in treatment, follow-up after hospitalization) by race/ethnicity,
gender, and rural/urban geography. 3) Assess the relationship between MMCO policies and alcohol treatment
outcomes (i.e.. treatment retention, pharmacotherapy duration, hospitalization, ED visit) by race/ethnicity,
gender and rural/urban geography. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely qualified with experience conducting
four previous commercial health plan behavioral health studies, and conducting rigorous disparities and
Medicaid analyses. Findings will provide valuable information on MMCO policies and their associations with
access, treatment appeal and cost for racial/ethnic minorities and other Americans. This information can be
used by plan administrators as they develop and implement policies, state Medicaid directors as they contract
with and regulate MMCOs, and federal policy makers making determinations about Medicaid waivers and other
efforts to improve access to alcohol treatment in the US.</description><investigator><investigatorId>STEWART, MAUREEN T</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01HD105712</grantId><grantName>Disparities in Perinatal Care and Outcomes among Black Women and Latinas with Physical Disabilities</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1415875.0</amount><startDate>2021-09-21</startDate><endDate>2025-08-31</endDate><keyword>Achievement, Achievement Attainment, Affect, Apgar Score, Birth, Parturition, California, Cesarean section, Abdominal Delivery, C section, Cesarean, Discrimination, Cognitive Discrimination, Emergency Situation, Emergencies, Focus Groups, Foundations, Future, Goals, Disabled Persons, Disabled Population, Handicapped, People with Disabilities, Persons with Disabilities, disabled, disabled individual, disabled people, individuals with disabilities, Health, Hospitals, Infant, Premature Infant, infants born premature, infants born prematurely, premature baby, premature infant human, preterm baby, preterm infant, preterm infant human, Small for Gestational Age Infant, small for gestational age, Inpatients, Interview, Massachusetts, Methods, Mothers, National Health Services, Obstetrics, Discipline of obstetrics, EPH Gestosis, Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Toxemias, Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis, pregnancy toxemia/hypertension, Pre-Eclampsia, Gestation, Pregnancy, complications during pregnancy, pregnancy-related complications, Pregnancy Complications, Pregnancy Outcome, pregnancy care, prenatal appointment, prenatal checkup, prenatal visit, Prenatal care, Public Health, Racial Group, Racial Stocks, Race, Recommendation, Research, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, Risk, Testing, Time, Woman, Gestational Diabetes, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes, pregnancy diabetes, Health Care Costs, Health Costs, Healthcare Costs, Healthcare, health care, physically handicapped, physical disability, physically disabled, Risk Assessment, base, Perinatal, Peripartum, improved, Infant Health, Link, disability, Health Care Utilization, health care service use, healthcare service use, healthcare service utilization, healthcare utilization, health care service utilization, Reproductive Health, Perinatal Care, Ethnicity, Ethnic Origin, Knowledge, Source, System, Gestational Hypertension, Hypertension induced by pregnancy, Hypertension-Associated Pregnancy Disorder, Pregnancy Associated Hypertension, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, pregnancy hypertension, experience, cohort, unborn, prenatal, stigma, social stigma, Adverse Experience, Adverse event, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, Intervention, 1 year old, 1 year of age, age 1 year, aged 1 year, aged one year, one year of age, one year old, Latina, Provider, Address, Data, Monitor, Characteristics, Development, developmental, cost, Outcome, ethnic minority population, ethnic minority group, ethnic minority individual, ethnic minority people, perinatal health, racial and ethnic, ethnoracial, infant outcome, pregnant, adverse outcome, adverse consequence, health data, social exclusion, marginalization, ostracism, ostracize, peer exclusion, improved outcome, adverse pregnancy outcome, health care disparity, disparate health care, disparate healthcare, disparity in care, disparity in healthcare, health care inequality, health care inequity, healthcare disparity, healthcare inequality, healthcare inequity, health service use, health service utilization, postpartum care, post-partum care, care providers, primary care provider, care costs, care outcomes, health care outcomes, healthcare outcomes, maternal outcome, obstetric care, adverse birth outcomes, pregnancy health, black women, black female, Latina Population, Latinas,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Women with physical disabilities experience stark disparities in pregnancy care, complications, and outcomes,
compared to women without disabilities. Black women and Latinas also experience substantial disparities
related to perinatal care and outcomes, compared to White women. Black women and Latinas with physical
disabilities, thus, are presumably at heightened risk of adverse experiences and outcomes. Nonetheless, no
known studies have investigated the intersection of disability and race/ethnicity in relation to perinatal care and
disparities. Preliminary findings from the investigator team demonstrate that Black women and Latinas with
physical disabilities are at substantial risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Efforts to improve their pregnancy
care and experiences while reducing costs require a definitive assessment of these women’s pregnancy risks
and outcomes. The overarching goal of this study is to use a mixed-methods approach to understand
pregnancy experiences, maternal and infant outcomes, related healthcare costs, and unmet perinatal
healthcare needs of Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities and their infants, and examine the
intersecting impacts of disparities from two avenues of marginalization (race or ethnicity, and physical
disability). The specific aims of this study are: 1) Compare perinatal care receipt, pregnancy-related
complications, health outcomes, inpatient healthcare utilization and costs among cohorts of women based on
race, ethnicity, and physical disability status, and determine if the combined effects of being a Black woman or
Latina with physical disabilities are additive or multiplicative; 2) Use linked data from Georgia, California, and
Massachusetts to examine first year health outcomes, healthcare utilization and costs for cohorts of women
based on race, ethnicity, and physical disability and their infants (&lt;1 year old), and determine if the combined
effect of being a Black woman or Latina with physical disabilities is additive or multiplicative; and 3) Identify
unmet needs and barriers to perinatal care for Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities through: (a)
interviews with Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities who are currently pregnant or have recently
given birth, and (b) focus groups with obstetric care providers. This study will lead to a first-ever systematic
understanding of pregnancy and infant health outcomes and pregnancy care costs for Black women and
Latinas with physical disabilities, thus establishing a foundation for development and testing of future
interventions to improve outcomes. This study will fill a critical knowledge gap in understanding of the

Communication between animals relies on sensory reception, transduction, and processing. Loss of hearing,
smell or taste alters social as well as environmental interactions, and adversely affects animal survival and
fitness. Primary cilia are present on all sensory neurons, including on olfactory neurons in the vertebrate nasal
epithelium. These cilia house all olfactory signaling molecules and are thus critical for sensory reception. The
organization of neurons and their processes within neuropils is known to be important for neuron function, but
the organization of cilia within sense organs is poorly studied. In the mouse olfactory epithelium, olfactory
sensory neurons (OSNs) in highly stimulated regions contain longer cilia, suggesting that ciliary patterns may
have functional consequences. The cilia of eight chemosensory neurons of the C. elegans bilateral amphid
sense organs are present within a channel formed by surrounding glia. These cilia are stereotypically
arranged, giving rise to specific cilia-cilia contacts. The functions of each of these chemosensory neurons are
known and can be readily assessed via imaging of stimulus-evoked behaviors and intracellular calcium
dynamics. Thus, this system provides an excellent model in which to study cilia organization and its impact on
chemosensory neuron functions. This proposal will investigate the molecular mechanism controlling cilia
organization in a sense organ, and whether this organization or the cilia-cilia contacts that arise from it,
influence chemosensory neuron functions. The results from this work will provide foundational knowledge
about cilia organization and its importance in chemosensory neuron function, a largely unexplored area of
chemosensory biology. The experiments described in this proposal will provide training in high-resolution
microscopy and quantitative analyses of chemosensory behaviors and neuronal responses. Additionally, this
proposal includes specific plans to enhance training in mentorship, scientific communication, and networking,
all of which are critical skills to become an independent researcher.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LAWSON, HANNAH N</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2129177</grantId><grantName>EAGER: Supporting and Learning From Principal Investigators “Making the Leap to Large”</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>165518.0</amount><startDate>2021-10-01</startDate><endDate>2022-03-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2042100</grantId><grantName>Collaborative Research: Modulation of pheromone-dependent host behavior by gut bacteria</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>850000.0</amount><startDate>2021-07-15</startDate><endDate>2025-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Sengupta, Piali</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2129310</grantId><grantName>EAGER: Creation and validation of a tool to examine the molecular mechanism of replication fork repair</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>299751.0</amount><startDate>2021-08-01</startDate><endDate>2023-07-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Lovett, Susan</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R03CA262920</grantId><grantName>Testing in-situ formed nanofibers for inhibiting metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) in murine models</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>162500.0</amount><startDate>2021-07-09</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword>Alkaline Phosphatase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, glycerophosphatase, Bone neoplasms, Bone Tumor, Osseous Neoplasm, Osseous Tumor, Cell Culture Techniques, cell culture, cell cultures, Cell Nucleus, Nucleus, Cells, Cell Body, Disease, Disorder, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Lung, Lung Respiratory System, pulmonary, Bone Sarcoma, Osseous Sarcoma, Osteogenic Sarcoma, Skeletal Sarcoma, osteochondrosarcoma, osteoid sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Peptides, pilot study, Pilot Projects, Research, Testing, Treatment outcome, improved, Solid, Phase, enzyme activity, Metastatic Osteogenic Sarcoma, Metastatic Osteosarcoma, Co-culture, Cocultivation, Coculture, Coculture Techniques, Therapeutic, programs, Reaction, In Situ, Services, success, tumor growth, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, model organism, Animal Model, Structure, nano tech, nano technology, nano-technological, nanotech, nanotechnological, Nanotechnology, NMR Spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, cancer therapy, Cancer Treatment, Malignant Neoplasm Therapy, Malignant Neoplasm Treatment, anti-cancer therapy, anticancer therapy, cancer-directed therapy, small molecule, Molecular Target, in vivo, Cellular Assay, cell assay, Patient-Focused Outcomes, Patient outcome, Patient-Centered Outcomes, Peptide Synthesis, Molecular, Development, developmental, Image, imaging, self assembly, design, designing, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, nanofiber, nano fiber, nanofibrous, innovation, innovate, innovative, anti-cancer therapeutic, anticancer therapeutic, clinically relevant, clinical relevance, mouse model, murine model, tumor, overexpression, overexpress, new therapeutic target, new drug target, new druggable target, new pharmacotherapy target, new therapy target, novel drug target, novel druggable target, novel pharmacotherapy target, novel therapeutic target, novel therapy target, targeted agent, improved outcome, primary bone cancer, primary bone tumor, anti-cancer, anticancer, nanofibrillar, nano fibrillar, nano fibrils, nanofibrils, Prognosis,</keyword><description>Abstract
 The treatment outcome of metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) remains poor and has not improved for over
four decades. Thus, developing novel approaches for treating mOS is urgently needed. We unexpectedly find that
enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) is able to form nanofibers (NFs) inside the nuclei of mOS cells and
selectively killing the mOS cells in cell culture. This proposed pilot study is to test the in-situ formed NFs for
inhibiting tumor growth in murine models. This research program will focus on two specific aims: Aim 1,
synthesis and characterization of the molecules for EISA in the nuclei of mOS cells; Aim 2, pilot study of the
EISA substrates for inhibiting mOS tumors in clinically relevant murine models. The rigor of prior research is that
(i) overexpression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a key feature of mOS, (ii) our preliminary results show
that EISA forms NFs inside nuclei to selectively inhibit mOS cells, and (iii) EISA forms cytosolic NFs to
selectively inhibit mOS tumors in vivo. The innovation is to target the nuclei of mOS cells by EISA. The
success of the proposed studies will contribute to the development of new molecular targeting agents for
selectively killing mOS, which may ultimately lead to breakthrough in treating mOS.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, BING

endosomal system in neurons. Exosomes are small extracellular membrane-bound vesicles that carry proteins, lipids, DNA and/or RNA from donor cell to recipient cell for disposal or intercellular communication. In neurons, exosomes can facilitate both the clearance and spread of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Exosomes are formed by invagination of the endosomal membrane to create a multivesicular body (MVB) which then fuses to the plasma membrane, releasing its intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) into the extracellular space. Our understanding of exosome formation and release comes largely from work done in in vitro non-neuronal cell systems, and while many of the molecules and pathways involved were identified in these systems, exploring neuronal exosome and endosome biology in an animal will be critical for understanding neuron-specific and physiologically relevant mechanisms involved in exosome formation and release. In particular, it remains unclear when and where MVBs are generated in neurons, and how exosome-directed MVBs are protected from conventional lysosomal degradation. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an excellent system to study exosome biology in vivo, and our lab has developed tools to track endogenously labeled exosome cargoes. These tools, in conjunction with easy genetic manipulation and imageability of the Drosophila NMJ, makes it a great system to study exosome formation and release. We have identified two pathways (ESCRT and Munc13- 4/Rab11) which we will manipulate to investigate endosomal dynamics surrounding the formation of the MVB and exosome release. The ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) pathway is involved in formation of the ILVs from which exosomes arise. I have shown that loss of Tsg101, an important component of the ESCRT pathway, leads to a loss of exosome release and an increase in presynaptic cargo levels. By tracking and manipulating Tsg101, I will determine the subcellular distribution and dynamics of exosomal MVBs and test the hypothesis that formation of ILVs/MVBs is temporally and intrinsically linked to cargo distribution, endosome maturation state, and exosome cargo function (Aim 1). Previous research has shown a requirement for Munc13-4 in exosome release, which requires the recycling endosome (RE) protein, Rab11. In combination with our work showing that loss of Rab11 leads to decreased exosome cargo levels, we will use this pathway as a tool to test the hypothesis that interaction between REs and MVBs promotes release of exosomes at the plasma membrane (Aim 2). Through this proposal I will expand my skillsets in microscopy, including high-resolution and electron microscopy, as well as quantitative image analysis and Drosophila genetics. I have also developed plans to improve my mentorship, leadership and science communication skills. Overall, training during the two years to complete this proposal will prepare me to be an independent scientist in the field of neuronal cell biology.</description><investigator><investigatorId>DRESSELHAUS, ERICA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R03AG072328</grantId><grantName>Locus Coeruleus Biomarker Development for Early Detection of Alzheimers Disease in Humans</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>325000.0</amount><startDate>2021-04-01</startDate><endDate>2023-03-31</endDate><keyword>Acceleration, Affect, Age, ages, Elderly, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Aging, Alzheimer's Disease, AD dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease dementia, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Anti-Inflammatories, Anti-inflammatory, Antiinflammatories, Antiinflammatory Agents, antiinflammatory, Back, Dorsum, Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Blood -

The advent of neuroimaging methods for measuring locus coeruleus (LC) structural
integrity has generated intense interest from scientific fields focused on Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), psychiatric disorders, as well as basic cognitive neuroscience. The LC is
the brain’s primary generator of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) and is one of
the first brain regions to accumulate hyperphosphorylated tau protein, a hallmark
pathological agent in AD. The ability to use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess
LC integrity opens up exciting possibilities for earliest detection of disease acceleration,
and may also provide an MR measure that captures information about individual
differences in neurochemical function. The ability to study neurochemical systems in vivo
in humans is limited, with imaging approaches using radioactive tracers being the most
established (e.g. positron emission tomography (PET)). However, due to the burden to
subjects, as well as the infrastructural challenges, PET imaging is not a tool many
researchers use despite the central role neuromodulatory systems like NE play in basic
cognition and disease. We will take initial steps towards testing the validity of LC MR
measures for predicting NE function by examining the correspondence between a
neuromelanin-sensitive MR measure of LC integrity and a PET measure of
catecholamine (norepinephrine/dopamine) synthesis capacity ([18F]Fluoro-l-m-tyrosine
(FMT)) within subject in healthy young and older adults (Aim 1). Accumulating evidence
in healthy aging, AD, and Parkinson’s disease suggests the catecholamine system
responds to injury and shows compensatory capacity. Next, we will test the hypothesis
that with advancing age, catecholamine synthesis goes up (Aim 2). Finally, to test the
utility of LC neuroimaging measures as forecasters of the advancement of tau pathology,
we will explore whether neuromelanin-sensitive MR and [18F]FMT predict the
accumulation of tau in the medial temporal lobe using tau-sensitive [18F]flortaucipir
imaging (Aim 3). Together, this research takes critical steps in establishing MR
approaches as sensitive to neurochemical function, examines intriguing mechanisms of

In the mammalian central nervous system, two main types of synapses – glutamatergic and GABAergic – play
opposing roles in exciting or inhibiting the postsynaptic cell. While it is critical that upon cell-cell contact, new
synapses form the correct postsynaptic specialization (excitatory or inhibitory), the molecular pathways
specifying this identity remain a fundamental mystery in developmental neurobiology. This process is
presumably regulated by trans-synaptic ligand/receptor partners that belong to protein families (e.g.
Neuroligins/Neurexins, Ephrins/Ephs, Semaphorins/Plexins) which have been demonstrated to regulate both
excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation.
Semaphorins (Semas) and Plexins are families of widely expressed and functionally versatile transmembrane or
secreted ligands and their transmembrane receptors that first gained attention for their roles in axon guidance
during nervous system development. Class 4 Semas and Plexin-B receptors are expressed in mammalian
hippocampus (in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in glia) and promote synapse formation both during
development and in adulthood.
Our previous studies revealed Sema4D to be one of few molecules having synaptogenic function restricted to
inhibitory synapses; the extracellular domain of Sema4D induces inhibitory synapse formation on a rapid
timescale (~30 mins) through the Plexin-B1 receptor. Additionally, Sema4A promotes formation of both
inhibitory and excitatory synapses in hippocampus via the Plexin-B1 or Plexin-B2 receptors, respectively. The
ability to rapidly drive synapse formation by application of Sema4A or Sema4D, as well as the observations that
these Semas regulate inhibitory and excitatory synapse formation in unique ways requiring different Plexin-B
receptors, are central to our proposed strategy to identify the distinct signaling conformations that
instruct synapse identity (excitatory or inhibitory) downstream of Plexin-B receptor
engagement. Further, we previously showed that Sema4D protein application increases
resilience to seizure in adult mice in vivo, a finding that supports the potential clinical impact of
this work.
The proposed research uses a combination of transgenic mice, organotypic hippocampal slice culture, gene
knockdown, and expression of mutant forms of Plexin-B receptors to examine the divergent roles of 1) unique
Plexin-B signaling domains, 2) a novel mechanism gating Plexin-B1 signaling in cis, and 3) contributions from
Plexin-B coreceptors, in excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation promoted by class 4 semaphorins.</description><investigator><investigatorId>ADEL, SUSANNAH

Robust neuronal signaling requires the coordinated function of several ionic currents (Hille, 2001). Voltage-
dependent ionic currents have nonlinear dynamics and their effects on membrane potential are strongly
interdependent (Bean, 2007). Adding to this complexity is the presence of rich genetic and epigenetic
organismal variation, which is one of the many sources of animal-to-animal variability in a population (Gibson
and Dworkin, 2004; Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008; Schulz et al., 2006). Nevertheless, biological systems
are extraordinarily robust, maintaining stability under a wide variety of physiologically relevant perturbations
(Braendle and Félix, 2008; Kitano, 2004; Masel and Siegal, 2009; Whitacre, 2012). The proposed work
investigates how degenerate neural circuits are related to one another and explores the consequences of
these functional differences on system robustness. This study will advance our basic understanding of single
neuron and circuit dynamics within a diverse population, which is relevant to the development of personalized
medicine to treat neurological disorders (Hamburg and Collins, 2010; Katsios and Roukos, 2010).
This project utilizes the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) model system. The STG is ideally suited for
studies of robustness because it produces stereotyped rhythmic motor patterns that can easily be classified as
robust or abnormal (Haddad and Marder, 2018; Marder and Bucher, 2007). Furthermore, the wild-caught
population used for this study will effectively capture natural biological variation. Crustacean habitats can
experience significant temperature fluctuations, and temperature robustness has been previously
characterized in the STG (Tang et al., 2010). Examining network activity across temperature will facilitate the
assessment of circuit robustness. The proposed research will use a combination of computational modeling
and experimental approaches to explore the role of an ionic current in different contexts, whether that be
across cell types or across variable genetic backgrounds. This work will test a hypothesis that functional
degeneracy among ionic currents may be masked in standard conditions but revealed under perturbations
such as elevated temperature. Another goal of this research is to characterize degeneracy between voltage-
dependent and synaptic currents. If this functional degeneracy exists, it could provide the means for a single
neuron to improve the function of a globally disrupted circuit. This would be a powerful mechanism of
robustness that would also permit variability in degenerate voltage-dependent currents.
The fellowship award will support a training plan consisting primarily of research activities in addition to
undergraduate teaching and/or mentorship and attendance at meetings and conferences that will support the
proposed research goals. The research training will be conducted at Brandeis University, an academic
institution with vibrant neuroscience and quantitative biology research communities.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RODGERS, HILLARY DENISE</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AI157194</grantId><grantName>The molecular and cellular basis of short-range host cue sensing in mosquito vectors</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2006466.0</amount><startDate>2020-09-21</startDate><endDate>2025-08-31</endDate><keyword>Aedes, Affect, Air, Behavior, Biology, Blood, Blood Reticuloendothelial System, Body Temperature, Chromosomes, Color, Cues, Dengue, Disease, Disorder, Disease Vectors, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Family, Genes, Goals, Human, Modern Man, Humidity, Insecta, Insects, Insects Invertebrates, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Ion Channel, Ionic Channels, Membrane Channels, Joints, Malaria, Paludism, Plasmodium Infections, Masks, Molecular Probes, Culicidae, Mosquitoes, Persons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Sensory Neurons, Afferent Neurons, Reproduction, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, social role, Role, Sensation, Esthesia, Specificity, Temperature, Testing, Work, Glutamate Receptor, Mediating, base, sensor, Physiological, Physiologic, Chemicals, Ingestion, insight, communicable disease transmission, infectious disease transmission, disease transmission, Collaborations, Anopheles gambiae, Reporter, Knowledge, Transient receptor potential channel, TRP channel, Distant, Sensory, System, high temperature, High temperature of physical object, mutant, Receptor Protein, receptor, success, cellular targeting, Basic Research, Basic Science, perceptual stimulus, physicochemical phenomena related to the senses, sensory stimulus, response, Hydration, Hydration status, Ortholog, Orthologous Gene, Address, Defect, Data, Detection, Molecular Target, Resolution, Molecular, Knock-out, Knockout, stimulus sensitivity, Behavioral, fly, Flies, vector mosquito, TRPA channel, TRPA1 Channel, transient receptor potential ankyrin, transient receptor potential channel subfamily A, vector control, vector, feeding, comparative, behavioral response, behavior response, Knock-in, knockin,</keyword><description>Mosquito disease transmission relies on the insect’s ability to feed on human hosts, a behavior driven by host-
associated sensory cues. Temperature and humidity are key short-range cues that promote the final stages of
host approach and biting, but little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of mosquito responses to
these cues, or whether these mechanisms are conserved among evolutionarily distant mosquitoes.
We propose to address these knowledge gaps by: 1) Probing the molecular basis and evolutionary conservation
of heat-seeking between the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (An. gambiae) and the dengue vector Aedes
aegypti (Ae. aegypti). 2) Investigating the (as yet unknown) molecular and cellular basis of mosquito humidity
sensation in An. gambiae. We propose to achieve these goals in three aims:
Aim 1) Probe the evolutionary conservation of heat seeking mechanisms. Mosquito blood-feeding
is thought to have a common evolutionary origin, but whether the mechanisms that control heat-seeking are
conserved across mosquitoes is an open question. We will test this conservation by comparing the roles of key
receptors implicated in heat-seeking in multiple mosquito species in order to reveal whether and in what ways
heat-seeking mechanisms are shared across vector mosquitoes.
Aim 2) Determine the sensory specificities of candidate humidity receptor-expressing neurons
in An. gambiae. Despite its importance for host seeking, mosquito humidity sensing is largely unexplored.
We will test the hypothesis that mosquito humidity sensors rely on relatives of receptors important for sensing
humidity in Drosophila. We will examine the stimulus sensitivities of the sensory neurons expressing these
receptors and test the role(s) of these receptors in detecting sensory stimuli.
Aim 3) Establish the behavioral roles of candidate hygroin An. gambiae. We will test how our
candidate receptors for humidity and temperature contribute to the mosquito’s behavioral responses to
humidity and temperature, as well as host seeking and blood feeding. We will also compare how host-seeking
roles relate to homeostatic roles in helping modulate body temperature and hydration state.
This work will identify molecular receptors and sensory neurons that detect temperature and humidity in
vector mosquitoes and establish their roles in mosquito host seeking and blood feeding. As these behaviors
supports disease transmission, these basic science findings have potential relevance for vector control efforts.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31NS113383</grantId><grantName>The heat shock response in an identified neuronal circuit</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>59575.0</amount><startDate>2020-12-01</startDate><endDate>2022-09-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Anoxia, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cells, Cell Body, Crustacea, Crustacean, Family, Future, Ganglia, Neural Ganglion, Gene Expression, Genes, Heat shock proteins, stress protein, Ion Channel, Ionic Channels, Membrane Channels, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Motor Neurons, Motor Cell, motoneuron, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Nervous system structure, Glia, Glial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Neuroglial Cells, Non-neuronal cell, Nonneuronal cell, nerve cement, Neuroglia, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, O element, O2 element, Oxygen, Paper, K element, Potassium, Proteins, mRNA, Messenger RNA, Saline Solution, Saline, Circulatory Collapse, circulatory shock, Shock, Specificity, Stress, Apoplexy, Brain Vascular Accident, Cerebral Stroke, Cerebrovascular Apoplexy, Cerebrovascular Stroke, brain attack, cerebral vascular accident, cerebrovascular accident, Stroke, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Temperature, Work, Measures, Physiological, Physiologic, Chemicals, insight, Individual, Chaperone, Molecular Chaperones, 70-kD Heat-Shock Protein, HSP 70, HSP70, hsp70 Family, Heat-Shock Proteins 70, HSP-90, HSP90, hsp90 Family, Heat-Shock Proteins 90, Heat Shock, Heat-Shock Reaction, Heat-Shock Response, Metabolic, Exposure to, Heavy Metals, Knowledge, metal toxicity, metal poisoning, Complex, Pattern, System, extracellular, interest, high temperature, High temperature of physical object, experience, stressor, central pattern generator, neural, relating to nervous system, neuronal circuit, neuronal circuitry, Modality, Nervous System Injuries, Nervous System damage, Neurological Damage, Neurological Injury, Neurological trauma, neurotrauma, Nervous System Trauma, Gene Expression Monitoring, Gene Expression Pattern Analysis, Transcript Expression Analyses, Transcript Expression Analysis, gene expression analysis, gene expression assay, transcriptional profiling, Gene Expression Profiling, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Property, response, Protein Family, Address, Data, Global Change, Motor, Collection, Preparation, Output, thermal stress, thermo stress, Metabolic stress, Trauma, Resistance, resistant, biophysical properties, biophysical characteristics, biophysical characterization, biophysical measurement, biophysical parameters, Crab stomatogastric ganglion,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The brain must constantly compensate for multiple destabilizing experiences while maintaining proper
function. Adaptive responses to perturbation have been well documented in a wide number of systems. What is
less well understood is how adaptation to one challenge affects the overall robustness of a circuit to other
challenges. Of particular interest are heat shock proteins (HSP), a highly conserved family of molecular
chaperones that are upregulated in the nervous system in response to a wide range of stressors. The proposed
work addresses the specificity of the heat shock response to different perturbations using a well described small
motor circuit, the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG).
Previous work in the STG has established the robustness of its motor neurons to high temperatures, altered pH
and elevated extracellular potassium. This wealth of knowledge allows me to compare the effect of three sub-
critical perturbations across the same set of identified neurons. Preliminary data on pooled neurons indicates
that different subsets of HSPs are activated in the STG in response to high temperatures compared to elevated
potassium concentrations. I will now compare the activation of HSP and other gene expression changes across
three perturbations in individual identified neurons. The proposed work will address how the neuronal
response to one perturbation may be generally neuroprotective, and how the response may be specific to
individual challenges.
The direct effects of HSP on the intrinsic properties of STG neurons will be determined. The F-I curves,
threshold and resistance of neurons will be determined both before and after application of HSP70 to
determine what specific effects HSP70 can have on intrinsic properties of identified neurons. In addition, I will
measure how such changes in intrinsic properties confer robustness to future perturbation.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RUE, MARA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>SL-1999023888</grantId><grantName>THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES PROGRAM KEEPS STUDENTS AND LIBRARY PATRONS CONNECTED TO BROADBAND SERVICES</grantName><funderCode>27</funderCode><funderAgency>Federal Communications Commission</funderAgency><amount>7080.0</amount><startDate /><endDate /><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2039443</grantId><grantName>I-Corps:  Manufacturing method for blends of anhydrous probiotic bacteria and low-water, high-fat content nut butters</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>50000.0</amount><startDate>2020-08-15</startDate><endDate>2021-01-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Menapace, Rebecca</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM142041</grantId><grantName>Ubiquitin-independent targeted protein degradation</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2139231.0</amount><startDate>2020-09-01</startDate><endDate>2025-08-31</endDate><keyword>Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, Drug Design, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Goals, Grant, Laboratories, Ligands, Methods, Post-Translational Protein Processing, Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry, Post-Translational Modifications, Post-Translational Protein Modification, Posttranslational Modifications, Posttranslational Protein Processing, Protein Modification, Proteins, Role, social role, Body Tissues, Tissues, APF-1, ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor 1, HMG-20, High Mobility Protein 20, Ubiquitin, ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3 Ligase, E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Ubiquitin Protein Ligase, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase E3, Site-Directed Mutagenesis, Site-Specific Mutagenesis, Targeted DNA Modification, Targeted Modification, Active Sites, 20S Catalytic Proteasome, 20S Core Proteasome, 20S Proteasome, 20S Proteosome, Macropain, Macroxyproteinase, Multicatalytic Proteinase, Prosome, Proteasome, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Proteosome, multicatalytic endopeptidase complex, Link, Event, particle, protein degradation, Metabolic Protein Degradation, Protein Turnover, Regulatory Protein Degradation, response, drug discovery, small molecule, Address, Dose, Proteasome Binding, Proteasome Interaction, proteasome bound, Ligand Binding, Ubiquitination, Ubiquitilation, Ubiquitinoylation, ubiquination, ubiquitin conjugation, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, rational design,</keyword><description>Project Summary / Abstract
Targeted protein degradation is an exciting new strategy in drug discovery. Such drugs have several
potential advantages: (1) new protein targets must be synthesized to reverse the effect of the drug,
potentially prolonging efficacy; (2) all the domains of the target protein are inactivated, potentially eliciting
different responses than inhibition of a single active site; (3) each drug molecule can inactivate multiple
target molecules, making efficacy event-driven rather than occupancy-driven, potentially lowering dose and
(4) simple binders can be converted into functional compounds, which may address targets considered
“undruggable”. The rational design of drugs inducing target degradation has almost exclusively focused on
a single over-arching strategy: localization of the target protein to a ubiquitin E3 ligase. The primary role of
ubiquitination is to localize the target protein to the proteasome, and experiments from several laboratories
demonstrate that proteasome localization is sufficient to induce degradation. These observations suggest a
ubiquitin-independent strategy for targeted protein degradation, wherein a target recognition ligand is linked
to a proteasome binding ligand (proteasome recruiter). Direct localization to the proteasome avoids issues
with E3 ligase localization strategies. Proteasome recruiters also have the potential to be tissue,

Retaining pre-existing patterns of histone modifications during early development and multicellular
differentiation is essential for the maintenance of cellular identity. Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) is
associated with the formation of transcriptionally silent, specialized chromatin domains also referred to as
heterochromatin. Heterochromatin establishment is essential for normal centromere and telomere function,
silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA elements and preserving lineage-specific patterns of gene
expression. The loss of H3K9 methylation is associated with genome instability and aneuploidy which are
widely recognized as the most common abnormalities associated with cancer. Heterochromatin establishment
is a dynamic process which involves weak and transient interactions between histone modifiers and their
cognate nucleosome substrates. Counterintuitively, these weak protein-protein interactions produce epigenetic
states that remain heritable across generational timescales. These dynamic properties associated with the
epigenome exposes significant conceptual and methodological gaps that this proposal will principally address:
1) How do dynamic epigenetic complexes consisting of histone modification readers, writers and erasers
assemble in vitro and in living cells? 2) How do histone modifiers traverse a complex chromatin landscape to
locate their sites of action? 3) How is epigenetic memory stored and transmitted across subsequent
generations? The current belief is that histone modifications function as inert scaffolds which passively
promote the localization of histone modifiers to distinct sites in the genome. Based on our recent studies, we
propose an inversion of this paradigm. Our results reveal that H3K9 methylation has an active role in
catalyzing the cooperative assembly of a heterochromatin regulatory complex. Our studies underscore how the
assembly of epigenetic complexes in an H3K9 methylation dependent manner restricts protein-protein
interactions to specific chromatin contexts. In this proposal, we will use in vitro biochemistry to reconstitute
heterochromatin regulatory complexes, single molecule imaging to define the order and timing of assembly of
these complexes in vitro and within a native chromatin context and a high-throughput microfluidic platform to
define how epigenetic memory is propagated within individual lineages. The real-time visualization of
heterochromatin assembly at high spatial and temporal resolution will illuminate how transient molecular
interactions can synergize to establish stable and heritable patterns of gene expression.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RAGUNATHAN, KAUSHIK </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21CA252364</grantId><grantName>Exploring enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) for targeting osteoblastic metastasis of prostate cancer</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>430496.0</amount><startDate>2020-08-01</startDate><endDate>2022-07-31</endDate><keyword>Acid Phosphatase, Alkaline Phosphatase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, glycerophosphatase, Androgens, Androgenic Agents, Androgenic Compounds, Therapeutic Androgen, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, bone, Malignant Neoplasms, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Cells, Cell Body, Cessation of life, Death, Disease, Disorder, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Hormones, Endocrine Gland Secretion, Therapeutic Hormone, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, male, men, men's, mortality, Neoplasm Metastasis, Metastasis, Metastasize, Metastatic Lesion, Metastatic Mass, Metastatic Neoplasm, Metastatic Tumor, Secondary Neoplasm, Secondary Tumor, cancer metastasis, tumor cell metastasis, Osteoblasts, Peptides, Phenotype, Research, Testing, United States, base, enzyme substrate, Site, Solid, Phase, enzyme activity, Co-culture, Cocultivation, Coculture, Coculture Techniques, Therapeutic, Malignant Cell, cancer cell, Malignant Tumor of the Prostate, Malignant prostatic tumor, Prostate CA, Prostate Cancer, Prostatic Cancer, Malignant neoplasm of prostate, programs, Reaction, In Situ, Operative Procedures, Surgical, Surgical Interventions, Surgical Procedure, surgery, Operative Surgical Procedures, Medical center, success, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, model organism, Animal Model, Structure, novel, Radiation, nano tech, nano technology, nano-technological, nanotech, nanotechnological, Nanotechnology, NMR Spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, Cancer Treatment, Malignant Neoplasm Therapy, Malignant Neoplasm Treatment, anti-cancer therapy, anticancer therapy, cancer therapy, Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic, Metastatic Prostate Cancer, Distant Cancer, Distant Metastasis, small molecule, Enzymatic Reaction, Biochemical Reaction, Molecular Target, Cancer Cause, Cancer Etiology, cell assay, Cellular Assay, Peptide Synthesis, Molecular, Process, Enzyme Inhibition, developmental, Development, imaging, Image, cancer microenvironment, tumor microenvironment, self assembly, designing, design, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, novel strategies, nano particle, nano-sized particle, nanosized particle, nanoparticle, Prostate CA therapy, prostate cancer treatment, Prostate Cancer therapy, innovate, innovative, innovation, resistant, Resistance, anticancer therapeutic, anti-cancer therapeutic, Cellular model, Cell model, clinical relevance, clinically relevant, tumor, overexpress, overexpression, new drug target, new druggable target, new pharmacotherapy target, new therapy target, novel drug target, novel druggable target, novel pharmacotherapy target, novel therapeutic target, novel therapy target, new therapeutic target, end stage disease, prostate tumor cell, prostate cancer cell, castrate resistant PCa, castrate resistant prostate cancer, castration resistant PCa, castration resistant prostate cancer, targeted drug therapy, targeted drug treatments, targeted therapeutic, targeted therapeutic agents, targeted therapy, targeted treatment, targeted agent, improved outcome, androgen ablation therapy, androgen blockade therapy, androgen deprivation treatment, androgen deprivation therapy, prostate cancer metastasis, prostate cancer progression, nano fibrillar, nano fibrils, nanofibrils, nanofibrillar,</keyword><description>Abstract
 Prostate cancer (PCa) remains as the most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
mortality among U.S. males that are mainly associated with metastatic diseases. Bone is the major site of distant
metastases of PCa. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective for treating hormone naive PCa,
the onset of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) confers androgen resistant phenotypes,
which is the end stage of disease without cure. Thus, developing novel approaches for treating mCRPC is
urgently needed. It is well known the reciprocal interaction between PCa and bone microenvironment resulted in
unique osteoblastic reaction that further promotes PCa progression. Thus, we hypothesize that dual targeting
osteoblast and PCa cells should lead to a novel single agent as an effective targeted therapy for mCRPC.
Therefore, we propose to explore enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) for targeting osteoblastic mCRPC.
The proposed research is to develop the EISA substrates that can undergo EISA by the actions of alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL) and acid phosphatase (ACPP) and to examine their efficacy in cell assays. This
research program will focus on three specific aims: Aim 1, design and synthesis of EISA substrates of ALPL and
ACPP; Aim 2, characterizing the EISA substrates of ALPL and ACPP and determining their activities in the co-
culture of osteoblast and mCRPC cells; and Aim 3, examining the efficacy of the EISA substrates for inhibiting
mCRPC in clinically relevant animal models. The rigor of prior research is that (i) it is well documented that
overexpression of ALPL is the feature of osteoblastic metastases and overexpression of ACPP is the
feature of PCa and (ii) our preliminary results show that EISA catalyzed by ALPL selectively inhibits
osteoblast model cells and EISA catalyzed by ACPP selectively inhibit CRPC cells. The success of the
proposed studies will contribute to the development of new molecular targeting agents based on ALPL and ACPP
overexpressed during the process of metastasis of mCRPC in bone, which may ultimately lead to breakthrough
in treating mCRPC.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, BING </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>8854468010</grantId><grantName>TO PROVIDE LOANS TO RESTORE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE VICTIMS OF ECONOMIC INJURY TYPE DISASTERS TO PRE-DISASTER CONDITIONS</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>0.0</amount><startDate /><endDate /><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>EIDLGT:3309134902</grantId><grantName>ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER GRANT</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>1000.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-09</startDate><endDate>2020-07-09</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>EIDLGT:3306020330</grantId><grantName>ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER GRANT</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>1000.0</amount><startDate>2020-06-24</startDate><endDate>2020-06-24</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>EIDLGT:3304778942</grantId><grantName>ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER GRANT</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>2000.0</amount><startDate>2020-06-19</startDate><endDate>2020-06-19</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>EIDLGT:3304381462</grantId><grantName>ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER GRANT</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>15000.0</amount><startDate>2020-06-17</startDate><endDate>2021-07-02</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>EIDLGT:3600223042</grantId><grantName>ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER GRANT</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>6000.0</amount><startDate>2020-04-19</startDate><endDate>2020-04-19</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1951369</grantId><grantName>Collaborative Research: Consequences of Environmental Stochasticity for the Spatial Dynamics of Savanna-Forest Transitions</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>65631.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-15</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Touboul, Jonathan</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA049776</grantId><grantName>Examining opioid use disorder treatment in Medicaid managed care plans: policies and outcomes</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2079246.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-15</startDate><endDate>2025-04-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Buprenorphine, Decision Making, District of Columbia, D.C.

This is a critical issue for state Medicaid
programs as rates of opioid use disorders (OUD) in the Medicaid population are almost twice as high as the
general population. Nearly 40% of people with OUD have Medicaid. Evidence-based treatments for OUD,
including the three FDA-approved medications, exist but are underutilized. Barriers to access and retention in
treatment are numerous and complex, including stigma, provider capacity and health insurance policies.
Federal and state governments regulate Medicaid Health Plans (MHPs); however the plans have discretion in
several areas including coverage, utilization management, network management, provider payment and
innovative policies. Plan policies directly affect individual access both through coverage and through provider
willingness to offer services, given lack of coverage, administrative headaches from utilization management
requirements and low payment rates. Despite the opioid crisis, there is almost no information or transparency
on MHP polices related to opioid treatment services.
The proposed study aims to systematically examine delivery and management of OUD treatment in MHPs, an
under-explored level where important decisions are made. We will conduct a national survey of MHPs and link
their responses to national data on health plan quality and to patient-level Medicaid data from three states in
order to examine outcomes. The specific aims are:
 Aim 1. Describe Medicaid health plan OUD treatment policies (e.g. coverage requirements, utilization
management, network design, payment, and innovative care approaches) across MHPs that contract with
50 states and the District of Columbia and identify state policies, market and plan characteristics associated
with OUD treatment policies.
Aim 2. Evaluate the relationship between Medicaid health plans’ OUD treatment policies and plan-level
rates of enrollee access to and quality of OUD treatment.
Aim 3. Evaluate the relationship between Medicaid health plans’ OUD treatment policies and patient-level
outcomes of OUD treatment (e.g. pharmacotherapy duration, overdose).
The study team is uniquely qualified for this project and will leverage expertise developed in four previous
NIDA and NIAAA-funded commercial health plan surveys of delivery and management of behavioral health
services and 2 previous NIDA-funded Medicaid studies. Findings will provide valuable information regarding
access to and effectiveness of OUD treatment under Medicaid plans. This information can be used by plan
administrators as they develop and implement plan policies, state Medicaid directors as they contract with and
regulate MHPs and federal policy makers making determinations about use of Medicaid waivers and other
efforts to address OUD in the US, to help stem the tide of OUD and its often-deadly consequences.</description><investigator><investigatorId>STEWART, MAUREEN T</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>5080787802</grantId><grantName>TO PROVIDE LOANS TO RESTORE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE VICTIMS OF ECONOMIC INJURY TYPE DISASTERS TO PRE-DISASTER CONDITIONS</grantName><funderCode>73</funderCode><funderAgency>Small Business Administration</funderAgency><amount>0.0</amount><startDate /><endDate /><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35GM134926</grantId><grantName>Selective Nitrogen Atom Transfer for Applications in Biomedical Sciences</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>812500.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-01</startDate><endDate>2026-06-30</endDate><keyword>Alkenes, Olefins, Amination, Biology, Biomedical Research, Carbohydrates, Catalysis, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutic Chemistry, Clinical Research, Clinical Study, Glycosides, glycosylation, Metabolic Glycosylation, Goals, Ions, Metals, Methods, Nitrogen, Research, Science, Temperature, base, Label, Biological, Series, Chemicals, Therapeutic, Fe element, Iron, tool, programs, Complex, Reaction, functional group, novel, drug discovery, small molecule, Synthesis Chemistry, Synthetic Chemistry, Organic Synthesis, Molecular, public health relevance,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 The long-term goal of our research program is to develop general and selective nitrogen atom transfer
methods that can generate new molecular entities through precise functionalization of both complex molecules
and simple commodity chemicals. A large number of therapeutic molecules and small-molecule biological
probes have at least one nitrogen atom; therefore, synthetic methods based on direct nitrogen atom transfer to
organic molecules are important synthetic tools. Although a variety of valuable olefin amination methods have
been established, new selective nitrogen atom transfer methods based on novel reaction mechanisms are still
urgently needed which can be effective and exquisitely selective across a broad range of substrates and
thereby fill important gaps of existing synthetic approaches. Inspired by these outstanding synthetic challenges,
we intend to discover new reactivity in three directions of selective nitrogen atom transfer and we will develop
new synthetic methods that hold the promise to become unique and enabling tools for organic synthesis and
medicinal chemistry.
 First, we will explore uncharted territory in iron catalysis and discover the iron-catalyzed olefin
amination that does not involve radical intermediates and would thereby be compatible with a range of
functional groups which are problematic with the alternative amination methods. Completion of this project will
provide effective methods for selective olefin amination in complex molecules. Next, we will discover a
fundamentally new cis-glycosylation reaction that does not proceed through an oxocarbenium ion and develop
a series of iron-catalyzed one-step glycal amidoglycosylation methods that efficiently connect glycals and
glycosyl acceptors to selectively afford 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages that are known to be difficult to form
reliably in high stereoselectivity using traditional glycosylation methods. Completion of this project will provide
an array of unique methods that fill an important gap in complex-carbohydrate synthesis. Furthermore, we will
explore an entirely new HN3 activation mechanism and develop a range of metal-free methods that enable
direct addition of HN3 at ambient temperature across a wide variety of unactivated olefins for azido-group
labeling of complex molecules. Completion of this project will provide a valuable tool of azido-group labeling for
applications in synthetic chemistry and chemical biology.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, HAO </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM135126</grantId><grantName>Macromolecular Structure and Mechanism</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>601451.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-01</startDate><endDate>2025-06-30</endDate><keyword>Molecular Structure, Macromolecular Structure,</keyword><description>Project Summary
This Training Program provides graduate students with advanced education in the principles
and practice of macromolecular chemistry, mechanism, and structure. All aspects of the
program - formal course curriculum, laboratory rotations, informal specialized area-interest
seminars, and intensive research in laboratories operating on the edge of discovery - are aimed
at the question: how do biological macromolecules work? How do proteins, membranes,
nucleic acids, and high-order complexes of these huge molecules use physical-chemical and
structural principles to act in the enormous variety of contexts that underlie biological function?
The Training Program provides support for selected students in the Graduate Program in
Biochemistry and Biophysics at Brandeis University. This is a flexible PhD program designed for
two broad types of students: those with strong quantitative backgrounds but who may have
weaker prior training experience in biological chemistry, and those with more traditional training
in biochemistry and cell biology. Our intention is to bring these two groups of students to the
same end-point and to prepare them for careers in basic research. Currently, 34 students are
enrolled in this Ph.D. program; the Training Program includes 25 participating faculty, from four
departments, working in the following areas: macromolecular structure determination by x-ray
crystallography and NMR, mechanistic enzymology, bioinorganic chemistry emphasizing epr
and Mössbauer spectroscopy, membrane transport and ion channel mechanisms, single-
molecule analysis, virology, chemical biology, computational biophysics, and protein evolution.</description><investigator><investigatorId>OPRIAN, DANIEL D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31GM139334</grantId><grantName>Coordination of multiple ADF-H family proteins in controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>63532.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-16</startDate><endDate>2022-07-15</endDate><keyword>Actin-Binding Protein, Actins, Affect, Competitive Binding, competitively bound, Biochemistry, Biological Chemistry, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Cardiovascular Diseases, cardiovascular disorder, Cell division, cell motility, Cell Locomotion, Cell Migration, Cell Movement, Cellular Migration, Cellular Motility, Motility, Cells, Cell Body, Cytoskeleton, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Endocytosis, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Family, Goals, In Vitro, Kinetics, Mammals, Mammalia, Microfilaments, Actin Filaments, Myofilaments, Fluorescence Microscopy, Fluorescence Light Microscopy, Morphogenesis, morphogenetic process, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Neoplasm Metastasis, Metastasis, Metastasize, Metastatic Lesion, Metastatic Mass, Metastatic Neoplasm, Metastatic Tumor, Secondary Neoplasm, Secondary Tumor, cancer metastasis, tumor cell metastasis, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, Phagocytosis, Play, Proteins, Role, social role, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Baker's Yeast, Brewer's Yeast, S cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae, Temperature, Testing, Tissues, Body Tissues, Work, Yeasts, cofilin, Glia Maturation Factor, GMF, Glial Maturation Factor, Fluorescence Anisotropy, Dissociation, Family member, Mediating, Tertiary Protein Structure, Peptide Domain, Protein Domains, base, Label, Site, Physiological, Physiologic, Biochemical, insight, Biological Process, Biological Function, depolymerization, Genetic, Complex, Side, Location, Cellular Regulation, cell growth regulation, mutant, actin2, actin 2, Structure, member, Regulatory Protein, regulatory gene product, genetic regulatory protein, Modeling, single molecule, actin depolymerizing factor, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Filamentous Actin, F-Actin, Protein Family, Address, Defect, Affinity, Data, Human Pathology, in vivo, Filament, Process, molecular imaging, molecule imaging, Image, imaging, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent, TIRF Microscopy, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy, predictive modeling, computer based prediction, prediction model, Impairment, overexpression, overexpress, genetic approach, genetic strategy, live cell imaging, live cell image, live cellular image, live cellular imaging, imaging approach, imaging based approach, recruit,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to understand how two different members of the Actin Depolymerizing Factor
Homology (ADF-H) family of actin-regulatory proteins, Cofilin and Abp1, influence each other’s interactions with
and functional effects on actin. Cofilin and Abp1 are highly abundant and ubiquitous in vivo, and they both bind
directly to actin filaments using structurally related ADF-H domains, yet these two proteins have strikingly
different effects on actin filament dynamics. Cofilin promotes severing, depolymerization, and debranching of
filaments, whereas Abp1 instead promotes assembly of filaments by Arp2/3 complex and protects (rather than
destabilizes) filament branch junctions. This raises a key question: how do Cofilin and Abp1 co-exist on the same
filamentous actin structures in cells, and how do they affect each other’s functions at these locations? Based on
preliminary data that I have gathered, my working hypothesis is that cells express a level of Abp1 that allows it
to carry out its functions in promoting actin assembly without interfering with Cofilin’s functions in actin
disassembly. Further, I hypothesize that this balance is achieved in part because of key differences in the binding
kinetics of Cofilin and Abp1 on actin filaments. However, my preliminary data also suggest that the same
physiological concentrations of Abp1 strongly interfere with Cofilin-mediated debranching of filaments. I
hypothesize that this is because Abp1 stably binds to branch junctions and competitively blocks Cofilin binding
to Arp2/3 complex. To test these models, I will use an integrated approach combining biochemistry and in vitro
single molecule imaging with genetics and live-cell imaging in S. cerevisiae. The aims of the proposal are: (1) In
vitro analysis of Abp1 effects on Cof1-mediated actin disassembly and debranching, and (2) In vivo
analysis of the relationship between Abp1 and Cofilin in regulating actin dynamics.</description><investigator><investigatorId>AGUILAR LOPEZ, REYNALDO

We propose to harness the synaptogenic potential of Sema4D signaling to increase GABAergic synapse
number, thus enhancing inhibition in neural circuits and suppressing seizures. This approach could be
beneficial to preventing the establishment of epilepsy, halting its progression, or suppressing hyperexcitability
during a seizure event.
Previously my lab discovered that the secreted protein Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) drives inhibitory synapse
formation on a remarkably fast time scale (i.e. minutes) in hippocampal neurons and slice cultured from the
pre-natal and neonatal hippocampus. We also demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of the
extracellular domain of Sema4D into the adult hippocampus rapidly promotes the formation of new
GABAergic synapses. Importantly, these data demonstrate that the molecular machinery regulating
GABAergic synaptogenesis in the young hippocampus remains functional in the adult and that this machinery
can be harnessed to modulate network excitability. We directly addressed this point by demonstrating that
Sema4D treatment protects against seizures induced by direct electrical stimulation of the hippocampus or by
intravenous infusion of the proconvulsant drug pentylenetetrazol. Further, we found that Sema4D treatment
restored the efficacy of diazepam in a rodent model of refractory status epilepticus.
Given the success of these studies, my laboratory has undertaken a new experimental direction to determine if
Sema4D treatment has therapeutic potential for human epilepsies. We will focus our work on the translatability
of Sema4D as an anti-seizure therapeutic for treating status epilepticus (SE). Unfortunately, approximately
30% of patients with SE are refractory to treatment with current medications including benzodiazepines. One
hypothesis about the origin of refractoriness in status epilepticus is that prolonged neural depolarization leads
to internalization of cell-surface GABAA receptors, thus reducing total inhibitory current in response to
GABAergic signaling (Joshi &amp; Kapur, 2012). We hypothesize that by acutely increasing the number of
inhibitory synapses using Sema4D treatment, we could maintain or re-establish benzodiazepine
sensitivity in the brains of these individuals. Second, in order to further our in vivo mouse studies of
Sema4D-dependent seizure suppression, and to further the translatability of our findings, we will explore
alternative methods of administering Sema4D (e.g. intravenous injection of virus encoding Sema4D) to mice.
Lastly, we will test the translatability of our findings with Sema4D in rodents by asking if Sema4D promotes
inhibitory synapse formation in human neurons.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PARADIS, SUZANNE </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21NS116316</grantId><grantName>The role of satellite glia in the maturation and function of the sympathetic circuit</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>444845.0</amount><startDate>2020-05-01</startDate><endDate>2021-10-31</endDate><keyword>Astrocytes, Astrocytus, Astroglia, astrocytic glia, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cardiovascular Diseases, cardiovascular disorder, Cardiovascular system, Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular Body System, Cardiovascular Organ System, Heart Vascular, circulatory system, Cells, Cell Body, Dendrites, Disease, Disorder, Ganglia, Neural Ganglion, Sympathetic Ganglia, Heart, Human, Modern Man, In Vitro, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neuroglia, Glia, Glial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Neuroglial Cells, Non-neuronal cell, Nonneuronal cell, nerve cement, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurosciences, Parkinson Disease, Paralysis Agitans, Parkinson, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsons disease, Primary Parkinsonism, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Spinal Cord, Medulla Spinalis, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Testing, Work, Measures, Mediating, Organ, Peripheral, Site, Acute, Chronic, Axon Terminals, Presynaptic Nerve Endings, Synaptic Boutons, Synaptic Terminals, Presynaptic Terminals, Superior Cervical Ganglion, Structure of superior cervical ganglion, Link, Cardiac Muscle Cells, Cardiocyte, Heart Muscle Cells, Heart myocyte, cardiomyocyte, Cardiac Myocytes, Individual, GP80-LNGFR, Low-Affinity Nerve Growth Factor Receptor, NGF Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor Receptor p75, Neurotropin Receptor p75, gp75 NGFR, p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, NGFR Protein, Dysfunction, Physiopathology, pathophysiology, Functional disorder, Co-culture, Cocultivation, Coculture, Coculture Techniques, Morphology, Knowledge, postnatal, Source, System, synapse formation, synaptogenesis, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, neuroregulation, neural cell body, soma, neuronal cell body, cholinergic, Structure, Position, Positioning Attribute, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Regulation, Property, response, CNS Nervous System, Central Nervous System, Neuraxis, Address, Receptor Signaling, in vivo, Preparation, Process, developmental, Development, neuronal development, neuron development, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, PD with dementia, Parkinson Dementia, Parkinson Disease dementia, Parkinson Disease with dementia, Parkinson's Disease dementia, Parkinson's disease with dementia, dementia in PD, dementia in Parkinson disease, Parkinson's Dementia, Population, cholinergic synapse, Coupled, presynaptic, postsynaptic, Nervous System control, glial cell activation, glial activation, DREADDs, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, experiment, experimental research, experimental study, risk factor for dementia, risk for dementia, dementia risk,</keyword><description>How neural circuits form and are modulated by local and long distance signaling is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Astrocytes are glial cells that provide one critical source of local signaling that regulates synapse formation and circuit function in the central nervous system (CNS). Less is known, however, about peripheral satellite glia that are found at the junctions between spinal cord neurons and peripheral sympathetic neurons. The neurons of the sympathetic ganglia provide critical neural control of peripheral functions, modulating the final output of central sympathetic drive, regulating peripheral organ function, and providing ongoing information to the CNS. Disruptions in the sympathetic circuit contribute to many human disorders, including neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia. Within the sympathetic ganglia, satellite glia enwrap neuronal cell bodies and the cholinergic synapses that form between spinal cord inputs and postganglionic neurons, yet how these glial cells contribute to the formation and function of the sympathetic circuit remains to be determined. We have shown that cultured satellite glial cells isolated from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) promote the development of structural synapses and synaptic activity of sympathetic neurons, indicating a potential role in setting circuit activity. In addition, satellite glial cell activity has been implicated in the acute
regulation of sympathetic-mediated cardiovascular processes, suggesting that these glia could provide short-term and long-term regulation in this system. Here we will perturb the activity state of ganglionic satellite glia in vitro and in vivo to test the hypothesis that these glial cells regulate the development and output of the peripheral sympathetic circuit by coordinating presynaptic and postganglionic neuronal properties. We will examine the effects of glia on the intrinsic, synaptic and functional properties of postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the absence of their spinal cord
presynaptic partners by selectively enhancing glial activity with the hM3Dq DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) in vitro. We will then use DREADD-expressing mice to investigate glial effects at synaptic sites originating from spinal cord inputs in vivo. These experiments will allow us to define the cellular mechanisms of glial actions and to determine their effects on the output of the sympathetic circuit.</description><investigator><investigatorId>BIRREN, SUSAN J</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS116375</grantId><grantName>Organization and Function of the Periactive Zone</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1519945.0</amount><startDate>2020-04-15</startDate><endDate>2024-03-31</endDate><keyword>Actins, Affect, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Biological Assay, Cellular Adhesion, Cell Adhesion, Adhesion Molecule, Cell Adhesion Molecule Gene, cell adhesion protein, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cell physiology, Cell Body, Cells, Clathrin, Communication, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Cytoskeleton, Disease, Disorder, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Endocytosis, Goals, Learning, Maps, Methods, Microfilaments, Actin Filaments, Myofilaments, Morphogenesis, morphogenetic process, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Synaptic Transmission, Neural Transmission, Neuroglia, Glia, Glial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Neuroglial Cells, Non-neuronal cell, Nonneuronal cell, nerve cement, Neuromuscular Junction, Myoneural Junction, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Probability, Proteins, Rest, Reticulum, Role, social role, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Synaptic Membranes, Synaptic Vesicles, Testing, Time, Work, segregation, Mediating, Site, biologic, Biological, Biochemical, Link, Individual, Recycling, polymerization, tool, Complex, Event, Techniques, System, Membrane, membrane structure, mutant, particle, receptor, Receptor Protein, Structure, Regulation, Modeling, Property, response, Binding, Molecular Interaction, imaging modality, image-based method, imaging method, Etiology, Causality, causation, disease causation, Homologous Gene, GeneHomolog, Homolog, Homologue, target SNARE proteins, t-SNARE, target membrane SNARE proteins, Data, in vivo, Monitor, transmission process, Transmission, Process, Image, imaging, presynaptic, synaptic function, synapse function, human disease, spatiotemporal, Geometry, vesicular release, vesicle release, high resolution imaging, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, genetic testing, gene testing, gene-based testing, superresolution imaging,</keyword><description>The goal of this proposal is to understand the spatial and functional organization of the presynaptic periactive
zone (PAZ), which is found adjacent to sites of synaptic vesicle release. The PAZ is a micron-scale structure,
occupied by dozens of proteins that work together in multivalent assemblies to couple membrane remodeling
to force-generating actin polymerization. Studies of PAZ proteins in many systems have suggested that these
proteins act at multiple steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle as well as in other synaptic membrane functions
(e.g. synaptic morphogenesis and receptor traffic). It remains unknown how the micron-scale organization and
regulation of PAZ proteins direct their membrane and cytoskeleton remodeling activities to these different
neuron-specific functions. We will use the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a powerful model
synapse, to decipher how PAZ protein assemblies, activities, and cellular functions are linked. Using high-
resolution imaging, we recently found that PAZ proteins occupy both overlapping and distinct domains within
the PAZ, and that proper segregation of PAZ proteins between these domains depends on their multivalent
interactions with each other. We have also recently described PAZ-dependent dynamic actin filament
structures, which represent a direct readout of PAZ protein activities in these different domains. Using these
tools, we will ask how synapses regulate PAZ protein activities and interactions in space and time, and how
PAZ organization underlies its diverse neuron-specific functions, in response to synaptic activity and
transmission. In Aim 1, we will determine how PAZ proteins are organized at resting and active synapses using
complementary fixed, live, and super-resolution imaging methods, and develop new quantitative methods to
describe their geometric relationships in PAZ domains. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that synaptic actin
patches represent clathrin-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling events, and identify the determinants of
synaptic actin patch assembly and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will ask how PAZ organization and synaptic activity
control diverse cell biological PAZ functions, including release site clearance and organization of cell adhesion
complexes. Overall, our experiments will explain how organization of the PAZ into distinct subdomains
underlies multiple functional and structural properties of synapses. PAZ proteins are implicated in multiple
neurological disorders, so deciphering their in vivo functions will be critical for understanding the etiology of
these human diseases.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RODAL, AVITAL ADAH</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>2002141</grantId><grantName>Travel Support for North American Summer School for Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI)</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>49012.0</amount><startDate>2020-04-01</startDate><endDate>2021-03-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Pustejovsky, James</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS116212</grantId><grantName>Cytoskeletal Roles of APC in Synaptic Remodeling</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>142947.0</amount><startDate>2020-08-01</startDate><endDate>2022-08-26</endDate><keyword>Actins, Affect, Biochemistry, Biological Chemistry, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Calcium, cell motility, Cell Locomotion, Cell Migration, Cell Movement, Cellular Migration, Cellular Motility, Motility, Cognition, Cognition Disorders, cognitive disease, cognitive disorder, cognitive syndrome, Cytoskeleton, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Dendrites, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptiform, epileptogenic, Exhibits, Feedback, Goals, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Human, Modern Man, In Vitro, Learning, Memory, Micro-tubule, Microtubules, mitochondrial, Mitochondria, morphogenetic process, Morphogenesis, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Mus, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Mutation, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Nervous system structure, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, nervous system disorder, Neurologic function, Neurological function, nervous system function, Nervous System Physiology, Glia, Glial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Neuroglial Cells, Non-neuronal cell, Nonneuronal cell, nerve cement, Neuroglia, CNS plasticity, central nervous system plasticity, neural plasticity, neuroplastic, neuroplasticity, Neuronal Plasticity, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Phenotype, Play, APC gene, APC - Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, APC Protein, APC genes, APC tumor suppressor, Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli Gene, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein, DP2.5, Porifera, Sponges, Proteins, Research, Role, social role, Seizures, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Spasm, Hyperkinesia, Hyperkinesis, Hyperkinetic Movements, Muscle Spasm, Muscular Spasm, Infantile spasms, Lightning Attacks, West Syndrome, X-linked infantile spasms, eclampsia nutans, flexion spasm, greeting spasms, infantile salaam, infantile spasms with mental retardation, infantile spasms-hypsarrhythmia-mental retardation syndrome, jackknife spasm, Vertebral column, Spinal Column, Spine, backbone, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Testing, Time, Universities, Wisconsin, Work, Mutagenesis, Genetics-Mutagenesis, Mutagenesis Molecular Biology, Mediating, Point Mutation, density, Neurologic, Neurological, Training, Stimulus, Binding Proteins, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, Collaborations, Letters, Morphology, Cellular biology, cell biology, Complex, Event, System, Visit, monomer, mutant, tumor suppressor, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, neural, relating to nervous system, Structure, Protein Gene Products, Gene Proteins, Regulation, Modeling, response, dendrite spine, Dendritic Spines, single molecule, COX7A-Related Protein, COX7AR Protein, COX7RP Protein, Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit VIIA Polypeptide 2 Like Protein, EB1 Protein, Mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit VIIA-Related Protein, COX7A2L Protein, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Plus End of the Microtubule, Growing End of the Microtubule, Length, Defect, Data, in vivo Model, Invaded, Molecular, Image, imaging, Pathway interactions, pathway, Impairment, directional cell, in vitro activity, live cell microscopy, recruit, in vivo evaluation, in vivo testing, conditional knockout, conditional knock-out,</keyword><description>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change structure at the cellular level in response to stimulus; this dynamic remodeling of neuronal morphology is the basis of learning and memory. Regulating neuronal morphology requires tight coordination between the dynamic microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. In neurons, the dynamic plus-ends of microtubules have been shown to invade dendritic spines and stimulate actin- dependent spine remodeling in response to synaptic activity. This indicates that microtubule plus-ends deliver and/or activate factors that locally induce actin assembly in the spine. However, the mechanisms underlying this microtubule-actin crosstalk has remained elusive. The tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) binds to microtubules and actin, and recent work from the Goode lab has shown that APC potently nucleates actin assembly and is required to coordinates actin and microtubule dynamics and allow directional cell migration. However, the role of APC in promoting actin assembly and microtubule-actin coordination in the nervous system has not been investigated. APC is enriched in dendritic spines and is trafficked in neurons on the growing plus ends of microtubule by the end-binding protein EB3. My preliminary data show that EB3 directly inhibits APC-mediated actin assembly by binding to the APC `Basic domain'. Other studies have shown that depleting either APC or EB3 diminishes the number of mature dendritic spines, consistent with APC and EB3 working together to regulate actin-dependent spine remodeling. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the role of APC-mediated actin assembly, and its negative regulation by EB3, in neuronal branching and dendritic spine morphogenesis. This will be achieved by live-imaging in cultured primary mouse hippocampal neurons using an existing dominant mutant (APCm4) that abolishes APC- mediated actin assembly, and newly generated APC mutants refractive to EB3 inhibition. Changes in neuronal morphology, as well as the levels and dynamics of actin and microtubules will be correlated with APC localization by fixed- and live-cell microscopy. These efforts will be facilitated by a strong collaboration with Prof. Erik Dent (University of Wisconsin Madison), whose lab will be visited for hands-on training in live imaging of cytoskeleton dynamics in neurons. In parallel, single-molecule biochemistry will be used to define the mechanism by which EB3 inhibits APC-mediated actin assembly in vitro. This information will be used to test two models in vivo for how EB3 regulation of APC-mediated actin assembly influences dendritic spines: (1) The `sponge model', which postulates that invading microtubules soak up EB3, releasing/activating APC to promote actin assembly and spine remodeling; (2) The `delivery model', which postulates that APC-mediated actin assembly helps to recruit EB3-rich microtubules to spines, leading to APC inhibition, and an accompanying shift in the available actin monomer pool to a branched-actin nucleator system (Arp2/3 complex) underlying spine remodeling. This work will uncover fundamental mechanisms of neuronal cell biology, which are highly relevant to our mechanistic understanding of human cognition and neurological diseases in which these pathways are altered.</description><investigator><investigatorId>FEES, COLBY P</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31EY031602</grantId><grantName>Behavioral State Gating of Neuroplasticity: The Role of State-Specific Neuromodulators in Firing Rate Homeostasis</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>96571.0</amount><startDate>2020-07-01</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword>Alzheimer's Disease, AD dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease dementia, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Animals, Attention, Back, Dorsum, Behavior, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptiform, epileptogenic, Feedback, Future, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Learning, Light, Photoradiation, locus ceruleus structure, Locus Coeruleus, Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis, blue nucleus, Mammals, Mammalia, Memory, CNS plasticity, central nervous system plasticity, neural plasticity, neuroplastic, neuroplasticity, Neuronal Plasticity, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Neurosciences, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Rattus, social role, Role, Sleep, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, Work, Mediating, Neocortex, homotypical cortex, isocortex, neopallium, improved, Acute, Chronic, disability, insight, Delta Wave, Delta Wave sleep, Slow-Wave Sleep, Long-Evans Rats, Scientist, Complex, Sensory, Source, Pattern, Viral, extracellular, Receptor Protein, receptor, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, neuroregulation, cholinergic, noradrenergic, Regulation, sleep diseases, sleep dysfunction, sleep illness, sleep problem, Sleep Disorders, Neuromodulator, Data, Molecular Target, Resolution, in vivo, Molecular, Behavioral, Behavior monitoring, behavioral monitoring, basal forebrain, Outcome, neocortical, monocular deprivation, optogenetics, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, DREADDs, behavioral plasticity, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>Project Summary
 It is clear that sleep and wake states have a profound influence on cortical plasticity and they are
necessary for many forms of functional learning and memory; they also represent distinct brain states, during
which sensory drive, neuromodulation, and activity patterns are dramatically different. Given that
neuromodulators are strong regulators of many forms of plasticity and cortical activity patterns, this suggests
that sleep or wake, via specific neuromodulators, may select for distinct plasticity mechanisms. This state-
specific selection of plasticity mechanisms has significant potential benefits; for example, it is critical that
Hebbian (positive feedback-mediated) and homeostatic (negative feedback-mediated) plasticity mechanisms
work together efficiently to keep complex brain circuits plastic and stable, and to avoid cataleptic or epileptic
states. The fact that the two types of plasticity have some of the same molecular effectors implies they could
interfere with each other if not appropriately segregated. Indeed, many studies have observed roles for sleep
and wake states in the efficacy of different forms of plasticity, but the results lack any explanation for how
state-specific plasticity selection may be occurring. Our lab has developed a robust way to study this
fundamental question by continuously collecting behavioral data and tracking single units from the visual cortex
(V1) of freely behaving rats during the well-established monocular deprivation (MD) paradigm. MD causes a
strong suppression of V1 firing via Hebbian LTD-like mechanisms over the first two days (MD1-2), which
induce homeostatic mechanisms that bring firing rates back to baseline levels over the next two days (MD3-4)
despite continued MD. Using this paradigm, we have already shown that this rebound, termed firing rate
homeostasis (FRH), occurs exclusively during active wake (AW; Hengen et al., 2016). Here, I will investigate
how AW specifically enables upward FRH. The major differences in V1 between AW (when upward FRH is
enabled) and both sleep and quiet wake (QW) states (when it is suppressed), are levels of cholinergic (ACh)
and noradrenergic (NE) input. ACh and NE contribute strongly to AW specific cortical activity patterns, are key
regulators of multiple forms of learning, and are known to cause a variety of modulatory effects in V1, allowing
for broad changes in synaptic efficacy. Further, my preliminary data confirms that inhibition of ACh neurons in
the basal forebrain (BF), which are the main source of ACh to neocortex, makes V1 LFP activity during AW
more like slow-wave-sleep. Therefore, I will test the hypothesis that upward FRH in V1 is gated by AW-
specific neuromodulatory inputs. I will test the role of BF ACh and LC NE neurons in enabling upward FRH
during AW using both chronic, global manipulations (DREADDs) and acute, local manipulations (optogenetic
approaches). Regardless of the outcome, these experiments will provide important insight into how behavioral
states can selectively coordinate distinct plasticity mechanisms in vivo and inform future hypotheses regarding
molecular targets and mechanisms of action for state-specific control of plasticity.</description><investigator><investigatorId>BOTTORFF, JULIET </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DA051155</grantId><grantName>Decision dynamics during a continuous-time foraging task: a reinforcement learning approach</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>68701.0</amount><startDate>2020-04-01</startDate><endDate>2022-04-15</endDate><keyword>Algorithms, Animals, Breathing, Respiratory Aspiration, Respiratory Inspiration, inspiration, Behavior, Animal Behavior, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Energy Intake, Caloric Intake, caloric dietary content, Complement, Complement Proteins, Decision Making, Economics, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Environment, Evolution, Family, Food, Food or Food Product, Future, Goals, Human, Modern Man, indexing, Learning, Learning Disorders, Memory, Methods, neurophysiological, neurophysiology, Pathology, pressure, Probability, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Rattus, Reinforcement, Psychological reinforcement, Research, Research Resources, Resources, Rewards, Testing, Thirst, Time, Travel, Weight, Measures, Decision Modeling, Natural Selections, base, improved, motor disease, motor dysfunction, motor disorder, insight, Stimulus, Individual, Policies, Measurement, Nature, Knowledge, Life, Hour, Source, System, Location, behavioral prediction, behavior prediction, Performance, success, neural, relating to nervous system, Structure, self control, Self-control as a personality trait, Palate, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Modeling, Sampling, Free Will, theories, Data, Update, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, Behavioral Model, reward circuitry, discounting, Consumption, addiction, addictive disorder, cognitive process, learning strategy, learning activity, learning method, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, Wait Time, decision making algorithm, learning algorithm, Computer Models, Computerized Models, computational modeling, computational models, computer based models, computerized modeling,</keyword><description>Project Summary
It is likely that evolution has strongly shaped the neural circuitry of the reward systems to optimize
performance in the many tasks involved in foraging for resources, a critical part of every animal's life. This
proposition was the inspiration for the development of “optimal” foraging theories, such as the marginal
value theorem (MVT), which derive analytically the foraging behavior (sequences of choices) that
maximizes the long-term rate of reward, usually considered to be energy intake. While these analytic
theories have had some success in describing animal behavior, the theories themselves rely on strict
assumptions about the environment that do not hold in many natural situations and are not flexible enough
to generalize to more complicated environments or other tasks. Therefore, the end goal of this project is to
understand which of a family of general-purpose decision (reinforcement-learning) algorithms is most likely
to be employed by the brain to solve value-based tasks and to use this knowledge to predict under what
circumstances these algorithms will lead to optimal or suboptimal behavior.
With this project, I will improve our understanding of animal decision processes in these more natural
environments by performing a foraging experiment that is continuous in time and violates many of the
assumptions that prior analytical theories of foraging rely on. Rats motivated by thirst will be allowed to
sample freely from two or three (palatable or aversive) tastant options (“patches”) in an open field and,
critically, will be allowed to direct their encounters with the options, something which past experiments have
lacked. Measurements of licking (consumption) behavior at each of the tastant options will allow me to
measure the decision dynamics of the rat over several 1-hour sessions. In particular, I will measure how the
sampling times at each option correlate with the values of the alternatives to gain insight into how rats
combine the values of available options to make decisions.
As a complement to this behavioral task, I will simulate a set of reinforcement learning agents that vary in
the rules used for learning action values, choosing actions, and planning actions. By quantitatively
comparing the decision behavior of these artificial agents to that obtained from rats I will determine which of
the simulated agents best reproduces the rat behavior, giving insight into the decision algorithms used by
rats and providing a direction for future electrophysiological recordings during this task. Importantly, this

This proposal focuses on the regulation of formins, a conserved family of actin assembly-promoting proteins that
nucleate and processivly elongate actin filaments at their fast-growing barbed ends. Specifically, it uses actin
cable formation in S. cerevisiae as a model. While formin structure and function have been defined in some
detail, comparatively little is known about how formin activities are spatially and temporally controlled in cells to
produce actin structures of a particular shape and size. Recent studies have shown that mammalian homologs
of capping protein (CP) and formin can bind simultaneously to the barbed ends of actin filaments, forming
‘decision complexes’ and catalyzing each other’s dissociation to tune actin growth and length1,2. These exciting
observations have raised new questions, including whether the decision complex mechanism is conserved in
other systems, and whether additional binding partners of formins and/or CP can influence the mechanism. My
preliminary data show that yeast CP (Cap1/2) and the yeast formin-binding protein Bud14 work in concert to
displace the formin Bnr1 from barbed ends. Thus, my data suggest a novel three-component (Bud14-Bnr1-
Cap1/2) decision complex used to regulate the growth of cellular actin structures. In this proposal, I will use in
vitro single-molecule imaging to visualize this novel mechanism in real time. Further, I will determine which
domains and molecular interactions of Bud14 contribute to the mechanism. In addition, I will use yeast genetics
and live-cell imaging to test the three-component mechanism in vivo, and determine how it regulates the proper
formation of actin cables with a characteristic shape and length optimized for secretory vesicle traffic. Finally, I
will use live-imaging to define the dynamic movements of Bud14 particles in cells, and Bimolecular Fluorescence
Complementation (BiFC) assays to study live interactions of Bud14 and Cap1/2 with Bnr1 at the bud neck.
Together, this work will provide new insights into how formins are controlled in vivo. This work will expand our
understanding of fundamental, conserved mechanisms controlling actin assembly in cells, and provide new
insights into the underlying basis of human disease states associated with defects in actin regulation. The specific
aims are: (1) Use single-molecule imaging to define the mechanism by which Bud14 and Cap1/2 collaborate to
control formin activity at the barbed ends of actin filaments; (2) Test the in vivo role of the Bud14-Bnr1-Cap1/2
mechanism in regulating actin cable length and polarized secretion.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WIRSHING, ALISON

reduced cortical activity. Paradoxically, these same disorders also greatly increase the risk for developing
seizures. Multiple homeostatic plasticity mechanisms can compensate for reduced activity by increasing
excitatory synaptic transmission and cellular excitability, and/or by decreasing inhibitory synaptic transmission.
But these normally beneficial mechanisms can have maladaptive effects, especially when reduced activity is
prolonged and occurs early, during a critical period of circuit formation. For example, activity blockade in vivo in
rat or mouse neocortex, induces seizures, but only if it occurs early and for a prolonged period. Here we
explore the mechanisms underlying this Maladaptive Compensatory Plasticity (MCP) in cultured neocortical
slices. Activity blockade produces a qualitative change in subsequent synchronized activity that persists
following prolonged deprivation when activity is restored. This is accompanied by a dramatic shift in the
balance between excitation and inhibition. Physiological and imaging studies are consistent with a dramatic
change in synaptic connectivity. Aim 1 will identify the critical physiological features of MCP, that separate it
from normal homeostatic plasticity. By blocking activity in single neurons, and by varying the timing and
duration of activity blockade, we will distinguish cell autonomous from network effects, and determine which
are critical for persistent effects of MCP. Using synapse imaging techniques and paired recording, we ask
whether induction of MCP alters the number of functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
 Aims 2 develops the novel idea of push/pull transcriptional regulation of homeostatic plasticity. We
identify a pair of closely related transcription factors (TFs) that are potently and progressively upregulated
during blockade of activity. Intriguingly, these TFs are part of a pathway that opposes compensatory plasticity,
since compensatory responses are exaggerated when they are knocked out. CRISPR-based manipulations will
be used to alter TF expression selectively in specific cell types. RNAseq will be used to identify candidate
targets, and chromatin assays will distinguish direct and indirect targets. Finally, we will initiate in vivo studies
to more directly test the role of homeostatic plasticity and its transcriptional regulation in audiogenic seizures.
Together these studies may identify new strategies for mitigating maladaptive consequences of normally
beneficial plasticity mechanisms.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NELSON, SACHA B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35GM134895</grantId><grantName>Molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating actin dynamics</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4100115.0</amount><startDate>2020-02-01</startDate><endDate>2025-01-31</endDate><keyword>Microfilaments, Actin Filaments, Myofilaments, Morphogenesis, morphogenetic process, Nucleotides, Organism, living system, Parkinson Disease, Parkinson, Primary Parkinsonism, Paralysis Agitans, Proteins, Research, Role, social role, Testing, Time, Body Tissues, Tissues, Work, Yeasts, cofilin, Glia Maturation Factor, GMF, Glial Maturation Factor, Dissociation, Mediating, coronin protein, Crnlp protein, coronin, biologic, Biological, Biochemical, insight, Individual, Funding, Biological Function, Biological Process, depolymerization, Anatomic Abnormality, Anatomical Abnormality, Deformity, Genetic, Knowledge, Complex, System, mutant, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Cryo-electron Microscopy, Electron Cryomicroscopy, cryo-EM, cryoEM, Intracellular Transport, Structure, new technology, novel technologies, genetic regulatory protein, Regulatory Protein, regulatory gene product, Regulation, single molecule, developmental disease, developmental disorder, Binding, Molecular Interaction, F-Actin, Filamentous Actin, hearing impairment, Hearing Loss, Hypoacuses, Hypoacusis, dysfunctional hearing, hearing defect, hearing deficit, hearing difficulty, hearing disability, hearing dysfunction, Defect, protein structure, protein structures, proteins structure, Mammalian Cell, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, in vivo, Filament, Molecular, Process, cellular imaging, cell imaging, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent, TIRF Microscopy, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, human disease, reconstitution, reconstitute, Acceleration, Actins, Affect, AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease, Gehrig's Disease, Lou Gehrig Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Animals, inhibitor, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, cardiovascular disorder, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cell division, Cell Locomotion, Cell Migration, Cell Movement, Cellular Migration, Cellular Motility, Motility, cell motility, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cell physiology, Cell Body, Cells, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Cytoskeleton, Cytosol, Disease, Disorder, Endocytosis, Limb structure, Extremities, Limbs, Non-Trunk, Goals, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Huntington Disease, Huntington Chorea, Huntington's, Huntington's Disease, Huntingtons Disease, In Vitro, Infertility, Cannot achieve a pregnancy, Difficulty conceiving, fertility cessation, fertility loss, infertile, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The overall goal of the NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and to explore how these mechanisms are
harnessed in vivo (in yeast and animal cells) to control diverse actin-based processes such as cell motility,
endocytosis, intracellular transport, and cell morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical research has been
rapidly producing a ‘molecular parts list’ for the actin cytoskeleton, and many of the components have been
characterized individually for their biochemical effects on actin filaments and their genetic effects on cellular
actin organization and function. However, it is becoming clear that most of these proteins do not function alone,
but rather in groups to perform their biological roles, and thus, new approaches are needed to define how they
work in concert to perform their cellular functions. Our lab is tackling this problem using advanced single
molecule TIRF microscopy to directly observe multi-component actin regulatory mechanisms in real time, and
testing these mechanisms using genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. Through this
approach, we have made fundamental new insights into actin regulation. For instance, we defined the first
collaborative actin nucleation mechanisms of formins (with Bud6 &amp; APC). We discovered that formins and
Capping Protein can bind simultaneously at filament ends to accelerate each other’s dissociation. We showed
that Cofilin, AIP1, and Coronin work together via an ordered mechanism to sever and disassemble F-actin. We
discovered that Srv2/CAP works in conjunction with Cofilin and Twinfilin to depolymerize filament ends. In
parallel, we have combined genetics, cellular imaging, and separation-of-function mutants to dissect the
contributions of these mechanisms to actin-based processes in yeast and mammalian cells.
Moving forward, we will ask the following questions: what are the complete regulatory cycles of the two yeast
formins (Bni1 and Bnr1)? How is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation balanced by its inhibitors (Coronin
and GMF) and activators (Las17/WASP and Abp1)? How is actin nucleation at the leading edge of motile cells
controlled by interactions among IQGAP1, APC and formins? How do interactions at filament ends between
Capping Protein and formins (and their in vivo binding partners) control actin network growth? How do the
filament severing and depolymerization mechanisms (Cofilin, AIP1, Coronin, Twinfilin, and Srv2/CAP) drive net
disassembly of actin under the assembly-promoting conditions of the cytosol? Are there actin-associated
proteins that accelerate the nucleotide state transition on F-actin to promote disassembly? In addition, we will
introduce new technologies and directions to our research, including in vitro reconstitution of cellular actin
structures, cryo-EM to study protein structure, cell-free extracts to genetically-biochemically dissect actin
mechanisms, and a systems-level approach to determine how genetic disruptions in individual actin regulators
affect the cellular levels, localization, and functions of the remaining actin-associated proteins.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GOODE, BRUCE L</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21DC018497</grantId><grantName>Towards molecular mechanisms of invertebrate Gustatory Receptors</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>453439.0</amount><startDate>2020-01-01</startDate><endDate>2022-12-31</endDate><keyword>Behavior, Biochemistry, Biological Chemistry, Blood, Blood Reticuloendothelial System, Buffers, Carbon, Cells, Cell Body, chikungunya, Crystallography, Crystallographies, Cues, Dengue, Diet, diets, Disease, Disorder, Disease Vectors, Drosophila melanogaster, Family, Fructose, Levulose, Future, Goals, Human, Modern Man, Insecta, Insects, Insects Invertebrates, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Ion Channel Gating, Ion Channel Gatings, Ligands, Malaria, Paludism, Plasmodium Infections, Membrane Proteins, Membrane Protein Gene, Membrane-Associated Proteins, Surface Proteins, Culicidae, Mosquitoes, Play, Proteins, Sensory Receptors, Neural Receptors, Neuroreceptors, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Role, social role, Smell Perception, Olfaction, Smell, odor perception, olfactory perception, Taste Perception, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Testing, Ticks, Ixodida, West Nile virus, Egypt 101 virus, WNV, West Nile, Work, Family member, Sequence Analysis, SEQ-AN, Sequence Analyses, sensor, Variant, Variation, Physiological, Physiologic, Biochemical, Chemicals, Stimulus, sugar, Collaborations, Complex, Protocol, Protocols documentation, Sensory, System, membrane structure, Membrane, Receptor Protein, receptor, success, Cryo-electron Microscopy, Electron Cryomicroscopy, cryo-EM, cryoEM, Cryoelectron Microscopy, receptor structure function, Structure, Nutrient, member, olfactory receptor, Modality, Position, Positioning Attribute, Property, disease control, disorder control, receptor function, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Homo, extreme temperature, Ortholog, Orthologous Gene, Data, Preparation, Molecular, Nramp protein, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein, natural resistant-associated macrophage protein, fly, Flies, vector control, feeding, human disease, comparative, insect disease vector, ZIKA,</keyword><description>Invertebrate Gustatory Receptors (GRs) are a large and evolutionarily diverse family of sensory receptors
known to play important roles in invertebrate taste, smell and thermotransduction. Given the importance of
these sensory modalities in host-seeking behavior in important humand disease vectors like mosquitoes, GR
family members serve as potentially powerful targets for vector control agents. However, little is known about
GR structure and function. We propose a physiological and biochemical analysis of members of two GR
subfamilies: Gr43a and Gr28bD. These initial studies will serve as a precursor for a subsequent R01 to carry
out structural and functional analyses of these GRs.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Identify and physiologically characterize multiple orthologs of Gr43a and Gr28bD.
Unlike most GRs, Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs can be functionally characterized in heterologous cells. In aim
1.a., we will express orthologs of these GRs from additional insect species, including disease vectors and
extremophiles, in heterologous cells and characterize their physiological properties. This will enable a
comparative analysis of sequence and function among each receptor class.
Aim #2: Biochemically characterize multiple Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs. We find Gr43a and
Gr28bD orthologs can be partially purified from heterologous cells. In aim 2, we will expand this approach to
incorporate additional orthologs characterized in aim 1 and optimize our purification protocol and explore key
properties including oligomeric state and thermal stability in various membrane mimics. This will provide
important biochemical information about GR complexes and identify orthologs best suited for subsequent
structural analysis.
The physiological characterization of multiple Gr43a and Gr28bD orthologs will enable direct examination of
evolutionary variation and conservation in GR family function. The expression and purification of multiple
family members will provide multiple candidates for biochemistry and structural determination, maximizing
the likelihood of success of subsequent GR structural determinations.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>USIP1904-20142</grantId><grantName>ASSESSING TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE FOR RECONCILIATION IN COLOMBIA</grantName><funderCode>458</funderCode><funderAgency>United States Institute of Peace</funderAgency><amount>298416.0</amount><startDate>2019-10-01</startDate><endDate>2021-09-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1939224</grantId><grantName>Collaborative Strategies for Successful Large-Scale, Distributed Science and Engineering Projects</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>119201.0</amount><startDate>2019-10-01</startDate><endDate>2021-09-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1920147</grantId><grantName>MRI: Acquisition of a GPU-Accelerated Research Cluster</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>349983.0</amount><startDate>2019-10-01</startDate><endDate>2022-09-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Hong, Pengyu</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA051067</grantId><grantName>Hub and Spoke Opioid Treatment Networks: 2nd Generation Approaches to Improve Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3218952.0</amount><startDate>2019-09-30</startDate><endDate>2023-08-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, alcohol use disorder, ethanol use disorder, Alcohols, Alcohol Chemical Class, Attention, Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Buprenorphine, Data Collection, Cessation of life, Death, Diagnosis, Disease, Disorder, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Experimental Designs, Health, Health Services Accessibility, Access to Care, access to health services, access to services, access to treatment, accessibility to health services, availability of services, care access, health service access, health services availability, service availability, treatment access, Household, Inpatients, Medicaid, Mental Health, Mental Hygiene, Psychological Health, Methadone, Adanon, Althose, Dolophine, Methadose, Methodology, Naltrexone, Nalorex, Nemexin, ReVia, Vivitrol, Persons, Outpatients, Out-patients, Overdose, Parents, Pharmacy facility, Pharmacies, Primary Health Care, Primary Care, Primary Healthcare, Research Design, Study Type, study design, Resources, Research Resources, Risk, Role, social role, medical specialties, Specialty, Substance Use Disorder, Surveys, Survey Instrument, Testing, Time, United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Washington, Generations, Measures, health care, Healthcare, Caring, improved, Acute, Clinical, Phase, co-occurring disorders, dual diagnosis, Ensure, AOD use, substance use, substance using, using substances, Alcohol or Other Drugs use, Individual, Opiates, Opioid, Funding, Nature, programs, Complex, Source, Pattern, System, physical health, physical conditioning, Services, suicide risk, suicidal risk, disorder model, Disease model, Modeling, behavioral health, QOC, Quality of Care, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, Intervention, vulnerable group, Vulnerable Populations, Effectiveness, Address, Data, Improve Access, pandemic, pandemic disease, care services, care systems, alcohol and other drug, Outcome, Population, Prevalence, innovate, innovative, innovation, network models, parent grant, parent project, public health relevance, overdose death, opiate use disorder, opioid use disorder, opiate crisis, opioid crisis, opioid epidemic, provider networks, service providers, health care outcomes, healthcare outcomes, care outcomes, heroin intake, heroin use, COVID19, corona virus disease 2019, coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, COVID-19 epidemic, COVID19 epidemic, COVID19 pandemic, corona virus disease 2019 epidemic, corona virus disease 2019 pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, COVID-19 pandemic,</keyword><description>Project summary/abstract
This competitive revision aims to better understand the co-occurring conditions of mental health disorders
(MHD), alcohol use disorders (AUD), and/or other substance use disorders (SUD) (e.g. stimulants) among
people with opioid use disorders (OUD), in order to improve the treatment and management of these highly
prevalent co-occurring conditions. The narrow focus to date on OUD and MOUD ignores the fact that many
people with OUD use multiple substances and often have MHD. Attention to the whole person and access to
comprehensive mental health and substance use treatment as well as primary care is needed. The notice of
urgent competitive revisions, HEAL Supplements to Improve the Treatment and Management of Common Co-
occurring Conditions and Suicide Risk in People Affected by the Opioid Crisis (NOT-MH-20-025), emphasizes
this need. Washington State is using two innovative approaches (Hub and Spoke (H&amp;S) and low-barrier Opioid
Treatment Networks (OTN)) to expand access to OUD treatment medications (MOUD). By encouraging the
building of integrated care networks that can treat the holistic needs of people with OUD, these models are
well-situated to improve care for people who with co-occurring disorders. Our parent study (R01DA051067), is
examining these innovations, focused on effectiveness of the models in access to and outcomes of MOUD. We
propose here a competitive revision to expand the scope, focused on co-occurring OUD and MHD and/or other
SUD. The specific aims are to: (1) Test whether the H&amp;S and OTN models improve use of MHD treatment for
individuals with OUD and MHD; (2) Examine the effectiveness of H&amp;S and OTN interventions for individuals
with OUD and alcohol, stimulant or other SUD; and (3) Determine if and where people with OUD and co-
occurring disorders access treatment for OUD, other SUD and MHD. This revision does not change original
aims, research design, data collection, or overall approach of the parent grant. It expands it by: 1) examining
MHD treatment quality measures and outcomes; 2) testing how these innovative treatment models compare to
other OUD treatment for people who have OUD and other SUDs; and 3) considering the ways people with
OUD access co-occurring disorder care. We will use 2015–2019 data already compiled by the parent project,
for care received by people with OUD recorded in Medicaid claims and state data for MHD/SUD agencies.
These data will be refreshed to include 2020-2022, which will also allow assessment of the COVID-19 impact.
We thus will benefit from conceptual, methodological, and data efficiencies with the parent study. The findings
from this study will provide needed information to improve mental health, alcohol, and other SUD treatment for
individuals with OUD, whether or not they are in OUD treatment. Further, in-depth analysis of how care is
delivered in the H&amp;S/OTN networks will allow us to assess whether these models are truly providing integrated
care that includes co-occurring disorders and how effective it is for this vulnerable population. These findings
may provide information to help move the system from siloed efforts to truly integrated care.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90DPGE0001</grantId><grantName>PARENTS EMPOWERING PARENTS: NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER FOR PARENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Administration for Community Living</funderAgency><amount>999999.0</amount><startDate>2016-09-30</startDate><endDate>2023-09-29</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90DPGE0007</grantId><grantName>INROADS: INTERSECTING RESEARCH ON OPIOID MISUSE, ADDICTION, AND DISABILITY SERVICES</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Administration for Community Living</funderAgency><amount>977639.0</amount><startDate>2018-09-30</startDate><endDate>2022-09-29</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM132499</grantId><grantName>Empirically testing the accuracy and bias of ancestral protein resurrection methods</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1381252.0</amount><startDate>2019-09-17</startDate><endDate>2023-08-31</endDate><keyword>Amino Acids, aminoacid, Attention, Systematic Bias, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Biologic Characteristic, Biological Characteristics, Biomedical Engineering, bio-engineered, bio-engineers, bioengineering, biological engineering, Biophysics, biophysical foundation, biophysical principles, biophysical sciences, Engineering, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Evolution, Gold, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Recording of previous events, History, Methods, Methodology, Modernization, Dehydrogenases, Oxidoreductase Gene, Reductases, Oxidoreductase, Kinases, Phosphotransferase Gene, Transphosphorylases, Phosphotransferases, Phylogeny, Probability, Probability Theory, genetic protein engineering, protein design, Protein Engineering, Proteins, Research, Substrate Specificity, Temperature, Testing, Time, Opsin, Rod-Opsin, Measures, Morphologic artifacts, Artifacts, Uncertainty, doubt, base, Site, Variant, Variation, Biochemical, Chemicals, Bayesian computation, Bayesian inference, Bayesian network analysis, Bayesian spatial analysis, Bayesian statistical analysis, Bayesian statistical inference, Bayesian statistics, Bayesian Analysis, Molecular Evolution, Knowledge, Frequencies, System, chromophore, thermolability, thermostability, sequence database, sequencing database, molecular sequence database, melting, Modeling, Sampling, Property, high throughput analysis, Protein Family, Address, Ligand Binding, Phylogenetic Analysis, Phylogenetics, trend, protein function, Development, developmental, vector, cost, reconstruction, markov model, design, designing, innovation, innovate, innovative, practical application, application in practice, biophysical properties, biophysical characteristics, biophysical characterization, biophysical measurement, biophysical parameters, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, high dimensionality,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) methods have now become widely used to experimentally analyze the
properties of ancient biomolecules and to elucidate the mechanisms of molecular evolution. By recapitulating
the structural, mechanistic, and functional changes of proteins during their evolution, ASR has been able to
address many fundamental and challenging evolutionary questions where more traditional methods have failed.
ASR methodology has also been highly successful in addressing biophysical problems in modern proteins, and
it has recently drawn attention for its practical applications in protein bioengineering and design.
Despite these advances, the accuracy, precision, and bias of resurrected ancestral sequences is currently
unknown. Are the most probable ancestral sequences systematically biased to have anomalous biophysical
properties? How well do the biochemical properties of resurrected proteins recapitulate the properties of the
true ancestral biomolecules? Which evolutionary models provide the most accurate ancestral reconstructions?
To give one well-known example of a potential bias, ancestrally resurrected proteins are often much more
thermostable than their modern descendants, and it is currently controversial whether the observed high
thermostability is a bona fide property of ancient proteins or rather is a methodological artifact. These
questions are extremely difficult to answer definitively because the real ancestral proteins are generally lost to
history, but we aim to provide experimental answers. This proposal will develop experimental methods for (1)
evaluating the systematic bias in ancestral resurrections, (2) assessing the accuracy of reconstructed protein
properties by comparison with the properties of the actual proteins, (3) validating competing evolutionary
models for ASR analyses, and (4) high throughput analysis of ancestral posterior distributions for evolutionary
studies and protein engineering.</description><investigator><investigatorId>THEOBALD, DOUGLAS LOWELL</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM125859</grantId><grantName>Characterizing a new role for timeless in the generation of robust and plastic circadian rhythms</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1619025.0</amount><startDate>2019-09-15</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword>Alternative Splicing, Alternate Splicing, Alternative RNA Splicing, Architecture, Engineering / Architecture, Behavior, Malignant Neoplasms, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Cell Culture Techniques, cell culture, cell cultures, Cells, Cell Body, Circadian Rhythms, Nyctohemeral Rhythm, Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm, circadian process, daily biorhythm, Complement, Complement Proteins, Cues, Mental Depression, depression, Disease, Disorder, Environment, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Feedback, Genes, Biochemical Genetics, Health, Human, Modern Man, Light, Photoradiation, Methodology, Motor Activity, Locomotor Activity, mRNA Precursor, Pre-mRNA, RNA, Messenger, Precursors, premRNA, Names, Proteins, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA, Splicing, RNA Splicing, mRNA, Messenger RNA, social role, Role, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Temperature, Time, Trans-Activators, Trans-Acting Factors, Transactivators, Genetic Transcription, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Work, Generations, Mediating, Variant, Variation, Physiological, Physiologic, Compensation, Financial compensation, Individual, Reporter, Hour, Complex, Event, Pattern, System, mutant, Isoforms, Protein Isoforms, Regulation, Modeling, Property, response, MicroRNAs, Micro RNA, miRNA, miRNAs, RNA Processing, Address, Data, Post-Transcriptional Control, post-transcriptional gene regulation, posttranscriptional control, posttranscriptional regulation, Post-Transcriptional Regulation, Sum, in vivo, follow-up, Active Follow-up, active followup, follow up, followed up, followup, Behavioral, fly, Flies, Pathway interactions, pathway, innovation, innovate, innovative, small hairpin RNA, shRNA, short hairpin RNA, circadian pacemaker, circadian clock, overexpression, overexpress, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, circadian,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Circadian clocks organize cellular, physiological and behavioral timing in 24-hour
cycles. Understanding how circadian rhythms are generated, maintained and
adapted to changing conditions is key. Indeed, several diseases such as cancer and
depression are associated with a misalignment between the circadian clock and the
external environment. The current model postulates that circadian oscillators keep
time by complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback loops. The
circadian component encoded by timeless (tim) has a special place at the center of
the circadian clock architecture. TIM is essential for circadian rhythms and, at the
same time, constitutes an entry point for external signals, such as light and
temperature, into the core circadian machinery.
Recently, we uncovered the existence of several mRNA and protein isoforms
generated from tim by alternative processing. These isoforms are subjected to
different types of regulation and encode proteins with different properties, suggesting
that the mechanisms mediating tim function are more complex than previously
though. Importantly, we found that temperature strongly regulates the relative levels
of the different RNA isoforms produced at a given time, likely by acting directly on tim
pre-mRNA processing. Importantly, we have found that elimination of one isoform
(named tim-s) results in abnormal locomotor activity and circadian rhythms,
demonstrating the importance of this regulation.
This proposal aims to unravel the importance of tim alternative RNA processing for
the robustness and plasticity of the circadian system. In order to do so, we will
first generate flies in which the alternative splicing of tim is locked into one state. This
will allow us to determine the functionality of the different isoforms. We will follow by
characterizing the mode of action of these tim isoforms. Last but not least, we will
determine the mechanisms by which temperature regulates tim alternative splicing.
In sum, this project will illuminate the mechanism of tim alternative splicing and
elucidate the functions of the different tim and per mRNA and protein isoforms.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KADENER, SEBASTIAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R00AG058748</grantId><grantName>Age effects on memory and reward systems in decision making</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>891737.0</amount><startDate>2019-09-15</startDate><endDate>2024-05-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Elderly, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Aging, Alzheimer's Disease, AD dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease dementia, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Cognition, Communities, Corpus striatum structure, Corpus Striatum, Striate Body, Striatum, striatal, Cues, Decision Making, Dopamine, Hydroxytyramine, Environment, Face, faces, facial, Family, Foundations, Future, Goals, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Human, Modern Man, Laboratories, Learning, Maps, Memory, Mentors, Methods, neurochemistry, neurochemical, Pathology, Personal Satisfaction, well-being, wellbeing, Positron-Emission Tomography, PET, PET Scan, PET imaging, PETSCAN, PETT, Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography Scan, Rad.-PET, positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging, positron emission tomographic imaging, positron emitting tomography, Quality of life, QOL, Dopamine Receptor, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Resources, Research Resources, Retirement, Rewards, Role, social role, Schools, Specificity, Task Performances, Technology, Temporal Lobe, temporal cortex, Testing, Tyrosine, Work, Measures, tau Proteins, MT-bound tau, microtubule bound tau, microtubule-bound tau, tau, tau factor, τ Proteins, Businesses, Mediating, Caring, base, career, Medial, Solid, Medical, Link, Training, young adult, adult youth, young adulthood, Fostering, Research Activity, Functional disorder, Dysfunction, Physiopathology, pathophysiology, Collaborations, Shapes, Deposit, Deposition, Functional MRI, fMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, programs, Complex, Pattern, System, experience, Performance, neural, relating to nervous system, skills, neuro-imaging, neuroimaging, novel, Ventral Striatum, Modeling, Decision Support Systems, response, Neuromodulator, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Address, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, Image, imaging, pre-clinical, preclinical, age related, age dependent, age effect, aging effect, financial decision making, neuroeconomics, hyperphosphorylated tau, hyper-phosphorylated tau, predictive modeling, computer based prediction, prediction model, tau aggregation, abnormally aggregated tau protein, filamentous tau inclusion, microtubule associated protein tau aggregation, microtubule associated protein tau deposit, paired helical filament of tau, self-aggregate tau, tau PHF, tau accumulation, tau aggregate, tau fibrillization, tau filament, tau neurofibrillary tangle, tau oligomer, tau paired helical filament, tau polymerization, tau-tau interaction, τ aggregation, design, designing, protein aggregation, insoluble aggregate, protein aggregate, Outcome, Cognitive aging, Individual Differences, innovation, innovate, innovative, imprint, dopamine system, cognitive process, Alzheimer's disease pathology, AD pathology, Alzheimer's pathology, support network, predictive test, predictive assay, Home,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Aging is accompanied by profound changes in neurochemical systems as well as accumulation of aggregated
proteins. To date, the influence of these processes on cognition has been studied in isolation. The proposed
research takes novel steps to bridge these fields to develop an integrative model of how changes across
multiple neural systems interact to affect high-level decision making in aging.
Candidate and career goals: This project will support the candidate’s essential training and development in
the field of cognitive aging, with a particular focus on how decline in reward and memory systems interact to
contribute to decision making ability. The candidate has a strong track record of research defining the
functional mechanisms by which neuromodulators shape cognition. To support the candidate in launching a
sustainable, cross-disciplinary independent research program, two expert mentors will provide individualized
training. First, the candidate will train in the field of the neuroeconomics and financial decision making, which
she will apply to the field of cognitive aging. Second, the candidate will train in PET methods for assessing
Alzheimer’s disease pathology and accompanying medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory function in older
adults. This novel research program will capitalize on the candidate’s established expertise while developing
critical skills to connect two important lines of cognitive aging research.
Environment: The exceptional resources and scientific community at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
and UC Berkeley Haas School of Business provide and ideal environment to foster the candidate’s
development into an innovative and successful independent investigator. The candidate will have access to
state-of-the-art human neuroimaging technology and will be supported by a rich institutional culture promoting
creative, cross-disciplinary collaborations.
Research activity: Aging is accompanied by 1) dysfunction of the dopamine system, which affects the
response to rewards in ventral striatum, and 2) aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, associated with MTL
degeneration and memory disruption. The proposed K99 studies will delineate the independent and interactive
roles of these processes in modulating central components of financial decision making: reward learning and
memory. These studies will combine PET imaging in healthy older adults, a novel laboratory task designed
specifically to probe striatal-MTL interactions, and a validated measure of real-world financial capacity. The
proposed R00 studies will pair the laboratory task with functional MRI to define the patterns of activation and
network activity between striatum and MTL that underlie age-related disruption in performance and best predict
individual differences in real-world financial capacity. Together, these studies will contribute to new models of
how cross-system interactions influence high-level cognition in aging while identifying potential targets for
remediating decline.</description><investigator><investigatorId>BERRY, ANNE SHIVELY</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90RTCP0004</grantId><grantName>COMMUNITY LIVING POLICY CENTER</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Administration for Community Living</funderAgency><amount>3699999.0</amount><startDate>2018-09-30</startDate><endDate>2023-09-29</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>90AR5024</grantId><grantName>ADVANCED REHABILITATION RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM ON HEALTH AND FUNCTIONING OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Administration for Community Living</funderAgency><amount>35472.23</amount><startDate>2015-09-30</startDate><endDate>2021-09-29</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>S10OD026777</grantId><grantName>High-speed 2-photon imaging of the living brain</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>579896.87</amount><startDate>2019-08-21</startDate><endDate>2021-08-20</endDate><keyword>Anesthesia procedures, Anesthesia, Animals, Behavior, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Decision Making, Disorder, Disease, Equipment, Eye Movements, Heart, instrumentation, Laser Radiation, Laser Electromagnetic, Lasers, Physiological Monitoring, Physiologic Monitoring, body movement, Movement, National Institutes of Health, NIH, United States National Institutes of Health, neuroplasticity, neuroplastic, neural plasticity, CNS plasticity, Neuronal Plasticity, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Neurosciences, optical, Optics, Visual Stimulation, Photic Stimulation, study design, Study Type, Research Design, respiratory mechanism, Respiration, taste response, taste processing, gustatory response, gustatory processing, gustatory perception, Taste, Gustation, Taste Perception, Technology, Time, Universities, Visual Perception, Generations, Artifacts, Morphologic artifacts, Microscope, Brain imaging, brain visualization, Stimulus, Funding, tool, Scanning, System, interest, relating to nervous system, neural, neurodevelopment, Neural Development, Speed, response, Dendritic Spines, dendrite spine, in vivo, Process, Image, imaging, two-photon, 2-photon, Behavior monitoring, behavioral monitoring, Imaging technology, optogenetics, in vivo imaging, imaging in vivo, imaging system, treadmill, two photon microscopy, two photon excitation microscopy, 2-photon microscopy,</keyword><description>Project Summary
A new generation of optical and optogenetic tools is allowing rapid progress in our understanding of
fundamental processes in the living brain and how these processes go awry in disease. One of the
key technologies underlying in vivo imaging is 2-photon microscopy, which allows fluorescent material
deep within the brain to be examined. In recent years, there have been major technological
improvements in 2-photon imaging systems that allow for faster and deeper imaging.
These new 2-photon imaging technologies allow qualitatively new types of studies. Resonant-
scanning technology that permits imaging at 30Hz allows neuroscientists to study neural responses to
single stimuli, on single trials, without averaging across time or trials. This 30Hz rate of acquisition is
also faster than many of the movement artifacts that occur within the living brain, such as respiration
and heart beats, allowing for artifact correction rather than blurring, and permits the study of sub-
neuron features such as dendrites and dendritic spines. New laser technology and new optical tools
allow the use of longer-wavelength indicators (such as red indicators), which can be stimulated and
examined at much greater depths than the traditional shorter-wavelength indicators. In short, recent
technological improvements have had a transformative impact on 2-photon imaging.
This project will provide NIH-funded systems neuroscientists at Brandeis University with a
sustainable, state-of-the-art in vivo 2-photon imaging station with accompanying instrumentation for
animal anesthesia, physiological monitoring, visual stimulation, and behavioral monitoring of eye
movements and movements on a treadmill. The clusters of instrumentation that will be assembled
have been carefully selected for performing advanced brain imaging in the living brain while animals
are anesthetized or are engaged in behaviors of interest. Currently, Brandeis has no in vivo resonant-
scanning 2-photon microscope, and this shared instrumentation will be a game-changing
improvement in our capabilities. The shared instrumentation will be placed in the middle of our
systems neuroscience labs to allow for synergistic interactions among the users. Importantly, this
equipment will immediately permit advances in our understanding of neural plasticity, neural
development, visual perception, taste perception, navigation, and decision making.</description><investigator><investigatorId>VAN HOOSER, STEPHEN D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM132498</grantId><grantName>Predoctoral research training at the interface of brain, body, and behavior</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>691859.0</amount><startDate>2019-07-01</startDate><endDate>2024-06-30</endDate><keyword>Behavior, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Research Training, pre-doctoral, pre-doc, predoc, predoctoral,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The goal of this training program entitled “Predoctoral Training at the Interface of Brain, Body, and
Behavior” (BBB) at Brandeis University is to produce a new generation of scientists equipped to
discover the mechanisms of a broad range of healthy and clinically disordered mental and behavioral
functions by applying both the core concepts and methods of psychology and the interface of these
methods with neuroscience and biomedical research. This new application under NIGMS PAR-17-
341 builds on a T32 program that is expiring after ten years of NIGMS support. Neuroscience at
Brandeis is an umbrella for extensive overlap of Psychology and Biology faculty, but co-training of PhD
students has thus far been prohibited by differences between the Psychology and Neuroscience
graduate programs. The old BBB program supported Psychology PhD students and provided them
with supplementary training in neuroscience and biomedicine, and the new BBB proposes to support
both Psychology and Neuroscience PhD students and to give them complementary co-training in each
other’s disciplines. Psychology appointees will be supported in years 1 and 2 and Neuroscience
students in years 2 and 3, but all will engage in BBB activities from year 1 to graduation. The old BBB
training grant had 3 NIGMS slots, and the new BBB proposes 4 NIGMS slots evenly divided between
the Psychology and Neuroscience, supplemented by one additional slot pledged by Brandeis
University. Psychology and Neuroscience have mutually revised their PhD programs such that BBB
students can satisfy departmental course electives with BBB-specific classes from the other program.
Additional required BBB co-training students includes research mentoring in the same laboratories,
research rotations, a common module for training in rigor and reproducibility, coordinated journal clubs,
and joint colloquia. These BBB requirements, departmental requirements, and enhancement activities
are designed to provide students broad and deep training on specific bio-behavioral problems and
quantitative training in research implementation and rigor as well as mentoring in how to develop,
communicate, and fund an independent scientific program. The training faculty include 12 members
with primary appointments in Psychology and 7 in Biology, all of whom are members of the Volen
National Center for Complex Systems which houses the Neuroscience PhD program. One of the
Psychology BBB faculty is a non-tenure track specialist who teaches and advises students on statistics
and research design, with a special emphasis on methods of rigor and reproducibility. Another major
aim of our program is to grow by attracting and fostering a diverse group of students. Over the past 10
years, 21% of students in the Psychology BBB program have been under-represented minorities, and
the Neuroscience program has enrolled 13-20% URMs per year, and we aim to continue this trend.</description><investigator><investigatorId>DIZIO, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>DESC0020194</grantId><grantName>STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF ENTANGLEMENT IN LARGE QUANTUM SYSTEMS</grantName><funderCode>89</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Energy</funderAgency><amount>349999.0</amount><startDate>2019-08-01</startDate><endDate>2021-10-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1910719</grantId><grantName>Observing LIGO/Virgo-triggered neutron star mergers with the Dark Energy Camera: a new path for Cosmology</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>53308.0</amount><startDate>2019-09-01</startDate><endDate>2021-03-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Soares-Santos, Marcelle</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32DC018453</grantId><grantName>The role of sensory cilia architecture in shaping chemosensory neuron responses</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>108747.0</amount><startDate>2019-12-16</startDate><endDate>2021-08-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, Anosmia, anosphrasia, loss of smell, olfactory loss, Architecture, Engineering / Architecture, Automobile Driving, driving, Behavior, Biology, Cilia, Communication, Cues, Environment, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Exhibits, Food, Food or Food Product, Genes, Goals, Health, Hearing, Human, Modern Man, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Membrane Proteins, Membrane Protein Gene, Membrane-Associated Proteins, Surface Proteins, Mentorship, Microscopy, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Nervous system structure, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Afferent Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Sensory Neurons, Organism, living system, Phospholipids, Phosphatides, Photoreceptors, Photoreceptor Cell, Photosensitive Cell, Visual Receptor, Play, Proteins, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Smell Perception, Olfaction, Smell, odor perception, olfactory perception, Work, Mediating, Caenorhabditis elegans, C elegans, C. elegans, C.elegans, Odorant Receptors, Odor Receptor Protein, Odorant Receptor Proteins, Olfactory Receptor Proteins, base, Area, Acute, Chemicals, Training, Stimulus, Individual, Genetic, Morphology, Shapes, Light Signal Transduction, Visual Transduction, Phototransduction, Complex, Sensory, Source, System, membrane structure, Membrane, mutant, trafficking, Structure, mate, Partner in relationship, olfactory receptor, Pathogenesis, Regulation, Modeling, response, Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene, Signaling Pathway Gene, Signaling Protein, Address, Defect, Detection, Resolution, Laboratory Organism, Experimental Organism, Signaling Molecule, Molecular, Process, environmental chemical, in vivo imaging, imaging in vivo, sensory input, olfactory sensory neurons, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, in vivo calcium imaging, In vivo two-photon calcium imaging, individual response, individualized response,</keyword><description>Project summary
Animals must detect environmental chemicals in order to locate food sources, recognize predators, and identify
mates. Molecules necessary for odorant detection are housed within the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons.
Defects in olfactory cilia structure, or the trafficking and localization of sensory molecules, result in anosmia,
suggesting that understanding the biology of these processes is highly relevant to human health. Cilia
structures range in complexity, and these morphologies dictate protein composition and the organization of
signaling molecules within them. Cilia structure can also be further modified by the environment, but the
molecular mechanisms driving these alterations remain unclear. Although cilia morphology is thought to be a
critical determinant for shaping sensory responses, the role of cilia architecture in sensory signal transduction,
and in particular for responses to olfactory cues, is poorly understood. The C. elegans sensory nervous system
is an ideal model in which to address these questions. Individual chemosensory neurons in C. elegans exhibit
diverse cilia morphologies, and each neuron type responds to a defined set of chemicals to drive attraction or
aversion behaviors. As in other organisms, C. elegans cilia house all olfactory receptors and signaling
molecules. Moreover, a subset of olfactory neuron cilia can be remodeled by sensory activity. These features,
combined with its genetic tractability and amenability to in vivo imaging, provide a unique opportunity to
elucidate key mechanisms responsible for shaping cilia morphology and function. This proposal will
systematically explore how specialized cilia morphologies contribute to the unique response profiles of
individual chemosensory neurons in C. elegans, and will identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which these cilia morphologies are further modified by sensory activity. This work will provide a framework for
understanding the pathogenesis of cilia-related defects in chemosensory signaling. The experiments described
in this proposal will provide me with valuable training in high-resolution microscopy, high-resolution quantitative
analyses of chemosensory behaviors, and quantitative analyses of neuronal function via in vivo calcium
imaging. Further, my proposal includes concrete plans to enhance my training in mentorship, networking, and
scientific communication, areas that are critical for my goal to become an independent researcher.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PHILBROOK, ALISON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R37NS112810</grantId><grantName>Activity-Dependent Regulation of CaMKII and Synaptic Plasticity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2069634.0</amount><startDate>2019-08-15</startDate><endDate>2026-05-31</endDate><keyword>21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, Affect, Allelomorphs, Alleles, Behavior, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Biological Assay, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Brain Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Brain Diseases, Cell Body, Cells, affinity purification, Affinity Chromatography, Communication, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Elements, Genes, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Learning, Maps, Memory, Metabolism, Intermediary Metabolism, Metabolic Processes, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Neuromuscular Junction, Myoneural Junction, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Proteins, Genetic Recombination, DNA Recombination, Recombination, Research, Rest, Ribosomes, RNA, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Role, social role, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, Time, Trans-Acting Factors, Transactivators, Trans-Activators, mRNA Translation, Genetic Translation, translation, Translations, Vertebrate Animals, vertebrata, Vertebrates, Work, RNA-Binding Proteins, Distal, Acute, Chronic, Specified, Specific qualifier value, biologic, Biological, insight, Individual, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, Binding Proteins, CaM KII, CaM PK II, CaM kinase II, CaMKII, calcium-dependent CaM kinase II, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Transgenes, Genetic, Reporter, tool, programs, longterm memory, long term memory, Complex, Event, Side, cell type, Pattern, System, Axotomy, mature animal, adult animal, mutant, Protein Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Synthesis, protein synthesis, immunoreactivity, fast axonal transport, Transgenic Organisms, transgenic, 3' Untranslated Regions, 3'UTR, Structure, Proteome, Regulation, response, Mushroom Bodies, RNA Interference, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Quelling, RNA Silencing, RNAi, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Bioinformatics, Bio-Informatics, Candidate Disease Gene, Candidate Gene, Address, Mutate, Regulatory Pathway, in vivo, Optical Methods, Phylogenetic Analysis, Phylogenetics, Translational Regulation, Preparation, preparations, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, fly, Flies, Synaptic plasticity, Coupled, presynaptic, synaptic function, synapse function, postsynaptic, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR, CRISPR/Cas system, genome editing, genomic editing, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, in vivo evaluation, in vivo testing, Visualization, genomic locus, gene locus, genetic locus, genomic location,</keyword><description>Abstract
Memories of salient events in our lives are part of what makes us individuals. CaMKII has been shown to be
required in both vertebrates and invertebrates for short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). CaMKII
protein is enriched at synapses, and is synthesized locally in response to activity patterns that lead to LTM
formation. Both of these features require specific sequences present in the distal untranslated part of the
CaMKII mRNA. In spite of extensive work on local translation of CaMKII, several fundamental questions
remain unanswered:
Is there a requirement for somatic factors in local translation? We will disrupt the connection between
the cell body and the synapse to test whether transport of somatic material to the synapse is required for
activity-stimulated local synthesis of CaMKII.
How is the information specifying local translation encoded in mRNA? Using transgenes encoding
fluorescent reporters and real-time assays of new protein synthesis, we will determine what sequences are
required for CaMKII synaptic localization and activity-dependent translation.
What are the cellular components that read this information? We will do a bioinformatically-driven
candidate gene screen in parallel with RNA affinity purification to identify proteins that regulate basal and
plasticity-stimulated CaMKII accumulation.
How does disruption of local translation of CaMKII affect LTM? We will use conditional genome editing
to remove mRNA sequences that specify local translation or to replace them with specific mutants. We will
determine which cells in the adult learning circuit use this information during LTM formation.

care. Some performance measures exist for substance use disorder (SUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD), but
they are focused on access to care, process of care, and short-term outcomes. Patient-reported outcome
measures (PROMs) offer an efficient way to monitor recovery as the ultimate outcome for SUD treatment and
quality of care. PROMs are fundamental to the principles of patient-centered care, encouraging self-efficacy
and shared decision-making, and if collected at multiple time points, capture of the course of chronic
disease. However, SUD PROMs may bring administrative burden and feasibility issues to the clinical setting,
and have not yet been tested in clinical trials. We propose a two-phase study, of people with OUD who are
receiving OUD treatment medication in an office-based model, that brings a patient-centered approach to
quality measure development and testing: First, refine a preliminary Recovery PROM, and assess its
implementation, feasibility and usefulness to patients and clinicians, incorporating their perspectives at each
stage. Second, conduct an RCT to rigorously assess implementation and effectiveness in a clinical setting.
 Specifically, the R61 is a pilot study of the preliminary Recovery PROM, in which we will: (1) Work with a
clinical partner to assess and refine the Recovery PROM, and examine feasibility and implementation (e.g.,
workflow, data transfer issues) related to its use in a clinical setting. (2) Determine its initial effectiveness for
improving patient outcomes (self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, patient-provider relationship, social
determinants of health, substance use) and facilitating self-directed care and patient-centered shared decision-
making. (3) Evaluate and update (if needed) the Recovery PROM in terms of recovery while on OUD
medication treatment, patient characteristics, and clinical workflow, and finalize the R33 RCT PROM and
processes. The R33 is an RCT of the Recovery PROM in community health centers, in which we will: (1)
Assess its implementation in the context of OUD medication treatment, in community health centers that offer
office-based OUD pharmacotherapy. (2) Determine if the Recovery PROM has improved patient outcomes and
patient-centered care for patients who use the Recovery PROM in the clinical setting compared to patients who
do not. (3) Define meaningfully important differences (MIDs) to establish thresholds associated with types of
recovery outcomes, to enhance shared decision-making and development into a performance measure.
 The proposed research will help to confirm the value of a Recovery PROM, determine the feasibility of its
implementation in the clinical setting, and, more generally, contribute to a dearth of research about the
feasibility of using PROMs. The Recovery PROM will be improved through patient and clinician input during
this study. In addition, the study will help to establish whether meaningful thresholds can be established for the
PROM, which would support future development of additional SUD measures of performance and quality.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>U01GM132367</grantId><grantName>Career Advancement and Culture Change in Biomedical Research: Group Peer Mentoring Outcomes and Mechanisms</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2787022.0</amount><startDate>2019-07-29</startDate><endDate>2024-06-30</endDate><keyword>Achievement, Achievement Attainment, Awareness, Biomedical Research, Career Mobility, career advancement, career transition, Control Groups, Faculty, Goals, Grant, Interview, Mentors, Methods, Minority Groups, Minority People, Minority Population, Minority individual, NIH, National Institutes of Health, United States National Institutes of Health, Peer Group, Physicians, Research, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, Safety, Science, Self Assessment, Survey Instrument, Surveys, Time, Waiting Lists, waitlist, Woman, Measures, Outcome Measure, Uncertainty, doubt, Ethnography, ethnographic, base, career, improved, Solid, Medical, psychologic, psychological, Training, Individual, Development Plans, Funding, randomized control trial, Randomized Controlled Trials, programs, Scientist, System, burn-out, burnout, experience, success, biomedical scientist, Structure, novel, Participant, peer, member, Reporting, Modeling, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, Intervention, Institution, Address, Academic Detailing, Ph.D., PhD, Doctor of Philosophy, Longterm Follow-up, Long-term Follow-up, long-term followup, longterm followup, Underrepresented Minority, Underrepresented Ethnic Minority, under-representation of minorities, under-represented minority, underrepresentation of minorities, Process, follow-up, Active Follow-up, active followup, follow up, followed up, followup, Development, developmental, Feeling, feelings, working group, work group, biobehavior, biobehavioral, Outcome, scale up, evidence base, primary outcome, secondary outcome, successful intervention, arm, STEM career, STEM workforce, science, technology, engineering and math career, science, technology, engineering and math workforce, science, technology, engineering and mathematics career, science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce, peer networks, academic program, mid-career faculty, associate faculty, associate professor, midcareer faculty, retention rate, retention strategy, student retention, peer coaching, peer instruction, peer led team learning, peer mentoring, peer teaching, Underrepresented Populations, Underrepresented Groups, under representation of groups, under represented groups, under represented people, under represented populations, underrepresentation of groups, underrepresented people, intervention participants, Home, Minority Women, Minority Female,</keyword><description>Abstract
To address the need for a more diverse biomedical and biobehavioral research
workforce, and to increase opportunities for effective mentoring for diverse and
underrepresented groups, we propose to implement a group peer mentoring program
for academic physician-scientists and PhD scientists engaged in biomedical research
that will result in enhanced career advancement and success, and high vitality. We will
conduct a randomized controlled trial of group peer mentoring with mid-career faculty
participants, as they are at a critical career transition point. Our primary outcomes are
measures of faculty vitality and career advancement. Hypothesized secondary
outcomes include enhanced cultural awareness and appreciation of difference and
diversity; use of key mentoring practices, and achievement of personal goals. Short-
term, intermediate and long-term outcomes will be measured by the following methods:
validated survey instruments; self-assessment (surveys and written narratives with
qualitative analysis); CV analysis for DPC Hallmarks of Success; supervisor
assessment. Specific factors that contribute to the successful intervention will be
assessed including the mechanisms of relationship formation, providing psychological
safety, reciprocity, cultural awareness and appreciation of difference and diversity; and
a structured process of academic career planning. We will conduct qualitative analyses
of ethnographic observation, participant interviews and written narratives to assess the
mechanisms, and participants will report on completion of each step of the detailed
academic development plan. This scientific approach to understanding a successful
mentoring intervention will contribute to the science of mentoring; be a basis for broad
dissemination of the intervention methods and mechanisms; and will be generalizable to
different institutions and career stages. The proposed evidence-based mentoring model
eliminates the frequently encountered pitfalls of traditional mentoring models and their
variable success, and provides a network of peers. One arm of the project is to assess
the use of mentoring practices learned in the intervention by gathering the perspectives
of the intervention participants' own home work groups. In this way, the specific factors
that contribute to successful outcomes will be disseminated across a wide variety of
institutions in the US.</description><investigator><investigatorId>POLOLI, LINDA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS112453</grantId><grantName>Gene regulatory mechanisms underlying temperature-dependent neuronal plasticity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>160817.0</amount><startDate>2019-08-01</startDate><endDate>2022-01-31</endDate><keyword>Animals, Automobile Driving, driving, Behavior, Animal Behavior, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Biological Phenomena, Biologic Phenomena, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase, CaMK, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases, Calmodulin-Kinase, calcium-calmodulin-dependent PK, calcium-calmodulin-dependent PK type II, calmodulin dependent protein kinase, microtubule associated protein 2 kinase, protein kinase II, Cells, Cell Body, Affinity Chromatography, affinity purification, Cues, Disease, Disorder, Environment, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Action Regulation, Gene Regulation, Gene Regulation Process, Genes, Regulator Genes, Transcriptional Regulatory Elements, regulatory gene, trans acting element, Genetic Screening, Guanylate Cyclase, Deoxyguanylate Cyclase, Guanyl Cyclase, Inosinate Cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Logic, Nervous system structure, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neuronal Plasticity, CNS plasticity, central nervous system plasticity, neural plasticity, neuroplastic, neuroplasticity, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Physiology, Production, Proteins, Ribosomes, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Signal Pathway, Temperature, Testing, transcription factor, Basal Transcription Factor, Basal transcription factor genes, General Transcription Factor Gene, General Transcription Factors, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, Transcription factor genes, Genetic Transcription, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Translating, Work, Measures, Mediating, Caenorhabditis elegans, C elegans, C. elegans, C.elegans, Biological, Link, Stimulus, Individual, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, CaM kinase I, calcium-dependent CaM kinase I, Genetic, tool, Complex, System, preference, experience, Receptor Protein, receptor, neuronal circuit, neuronal circuitry, Address, fitness, Data, Regulatory Element, Regulatory Pathway, in vivo, Laboratory Organism, Experimental Organism, Tissue-Specific Gene Expression, Differential Gene Expression, Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression, Molecular, Process, Modification, Behavioral, Output, environmental change, presynaptic, genome-wide, genome scale, genomewide, differential expression, differentially expressed, transcriptional differences, behavioral plasticity, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>In order to survive, animals must modify their behavior as they encounter new environmental conditions. To
achieve this, the nervous system integrates complex external stimuli and modifies its activity appropriately.
Ultimately, plasticity at the level of single neurons enables these changes, and in many cases neuronal and
behavioral plasticity is long-lasting. Changes in gene expression have been shown to underlie many forms
of long-term plasticity, and disruption of these expression changes and their upstream regulators are
associated with neurological disease. Here I propose to take advantage of temperature-dependent neuronal
and behavioral plasticity in C. elegans, phenomena that are biologically relevant, easily manipulated, and
quantifiable, in order to interrogate the gene expression changes and gene regulatory mechanisms
underlying plasticity in vivo. Our lab and others have characterized plasticity of temperature preference
behavior in C. elegans. We have established that modulation of the physiology of the single thermosensory
neuron pair AFD contributes to behavioral plasticity. We have identified receptor-type guanylyl cyclases as
likely thermosensory genes acting in AFD and shown that they are regulated by temperature at the level of
transcription. In this proposal I use this single cell plasticity paradigm as an avenue to conduct detailed
analyses of gene regulatory systems driving neuronal plasticity and to connect them to animal behavior.
First, I describe experiments to identify genome-wide the genes that are differentially expressed in AFD and
mediate the dynamic progression of plasticity. Then, I outline a strategy to uncover the molecular regulatory
principles that control expression of thermosensory rGCs during temperature-induced plasticity. My
proposed project will describe in great detail the gene regulatory pathways driving neuronal plasticity in vivo
and link them to behavior. This work will define the relationships among an environmental input, stimulus-
induced gene expression, and neuronal plasticity that enables accurate transformation of neuronal output
and behavior. Additionally, characterization of gene regulatory pathways that dynamically and precisely
control neuronal plasticity may help to explain how they can fail in the context of neurological disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HARRIS, NATHAN CHRISTOPHER STEPHENSON</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AG061640</grantId><grantName>Inhibition of mTOR by a small molecule activator of TSC2</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>460030.08</amount><startDate>2019-07-15</startDate><endDate>2022-03-31</endDate><keyword>Age, ages, Aging, inhibitor/antagonist, inhibitor, Atherosclerosis, Atheroscleroses, Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, atheromatosis, atherosclerotic disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease, Malignant Neoplasms, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, cell growth, Cellular Expansion, Cellular Growth, Cell physiology, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cells, Cell Body, Diabetes Mellitus, diabetes, Disease, Disorder, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Epidemic, Goals, Guanosine Triphosphate, GTP, Human, Modern Man, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Longevity, Length of Life, life span, lifespan, Lysosomes, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Muscular Atrophy, Muscle Atrophy, muscle breakdown, muscle degradation, muscle deterioration, muscle loss, muscle wasting, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, Obesity, adiposity, corpulence, corpulency, corpulentia, obese, obese people, obese person, obese population, Phosphorylation, Protein Phosphorylation, Proteins, Retinal Diseases, Retinal Disorder, retina disease, retina disorder, retinopathy, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Testing, Yeasts, GTPase-Activating Proteins, GAP Proteins, guanosinetriphosphatase activating protein, Sirolimus, Rapamune, Rapamycin, Generations, base, improved, Site, analog, Therapeutic, Nature, Immunes, Immune, Complex, Cellular Regulation, cell growth regulation, Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Synthesis, protein synthesis, Protein Biosynthesis, Toxicities, Toxic effect, novel, TSC2, TSC4, TSC4 Gene, Tuberin, TSC2 gene, Regulation, Modeling, Proteomics, Myocardial Diseases, Myocardial Disorder, Myocardiopathies, myocardium disease, myocardium disorder, Cardiomyopathies, ubiquilin, nutrient sensing, perception of nutrients, detection of nutrient, Molecular Interaction, Binding, preventing, prevent, small molecule, Hearing Loss, Hypoacuses, Hypoacusis, dysfunctional hearing, hearing defect, hearing deficit, hearing difficulty, hearing disability, hearing dysfunction, hearing impairment, FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1, FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1, FRAP1, FRAP2, Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin, RAFT1, mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin, FRAP1 gene, Address, Rodent Model, Ubiquitilation, Ubiquitinoylation, ubiquination, ubiquitin conjugation, Ubiquitination, Characteristics, Molecular, Process, pathway, Pathway interactions, age dependent, age related, knockdown, knock-down, resistant, Resistance, murine model, mouse model, treatment strategy, small molecule inhibitor, Growth Agents, Growth Substances, Proteins Growth Factors, Growth Factor, experiment, experimental research, experimental study, baby boomer, side effect,</keyword><description>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of
cell growth. Commensurate with mTORC1's importance, a complex network of growth
factor signaling and nutrient sensing pathways regulate mTORC1 activity, which in turn
regulates protein synthesis and many other cellular processes. Hyperactivation of
mTORC1 signaling is a common feature of the diseases and conditions of aging.
mTORC1 inhibition is a promising treatment strategy for these diseases. mTORC1
inhibitors increase improve prevent cancer, decrease obesity and reverse age-related
immune decline in humans and display activity in rodent models of neurodegeneration,
cardiomyopathy, atheroscelerosis, retinopathy and hearing loss. mTORC1 inhibitors
also increase lifespan in mice, worms and yeast. We have discovered a small molecule
(CB3A) that inhibits mTORC1 signaling via a novel mechanism. Unlike other small
molecule inhibitors of mTORC1, CB3A preferentially decreases the phosphorylation of
4EBP1 relative to S6K. Thus CB3A-inspired drugs may provide a therapeutic benefit for
diseases/conditions where 4EBP1 phosphorylation is the driver. These
diseases/conditions include cancer, diabetes and muscle loss. However, mTORC1
hyperactivation can derive from diverse underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore
the goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism of CB3A action. This information
is required to identify which diseases are most likely to respond to a CB3A-inspired
treatment strategy. Our preliminary results show that CB3A increases the ubiquitination
of the negative mTORC1 regulator TSC2. Although the regulation of TSC2 by
phosphorylation is well recognized, little is known about the role of ubiquitination in
TSC2/mTORC1 regulation. CB3A itself is unlikely to have therapeutic value, but
understanding the mechanism of CB3A inhibition is likely to identify new potential
targets as well as new facets of mTORC1 regulation.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HEDSTROM, LIZBETH

Sleep is a widely conserved behavior and it is known to be regulated by changes in gene expression.
However, the molecular basis of the regulation of sleep remains poorly understood. Research from our lab,
and elsewhere, supports the idea that microRNAs (miRs) are involved. miRs are short non-coding RNA
transcripts (20-24 bp in length) that target specific mRNAs, downregulating their expression. Results from a
genetic screen in which miRs were downregulated by expression of transgenes which specifically bind
particular miRs (miR-SPs), demonstrated that miR-190 is involved in Drosophila sleep regulation. Pan-
neuronal expression of miR-190-SP or mutation of the miR-190 gene both elicited dramatic changes in
Drosophila sleep behavior, including decreased and fragmented total sleep, as well as deficient sleep
homeostasis. Expression of miR-190-SP in limited numbers of cells in different brain regions using the
Gal4/UAS system showed that disruption of miR-190 function must occur in a large number of neurons to
affect Drosophila sleep regulation. At the molecular level, our preliminary data from RNA seq of adult heads
showed that pan-neuronal expression of miR-190-SP induces an up or downregulation of multiple genes,
including 9 genes which are intimately involved in dopamine (DA) signaling, the major pro-arousal system
of the fly. Temporally-controlled expression of miR-190-SP demonstrated that the full miR-190 knockdown
phenotype requires expression during the middle of pupation; reduction of miR-190 only in earlier
developmental stages produced no phenotype. Adult-specific expression minimally affected sleep time, but
disrupted homeostasis. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-190 functions during development to
specify the activity of the adult arousal system and has an on-going role in adult sleep homeostasis. This
proposal aims to unravel the developmental role of miR-190 in the establishment of adult
sleep behaviors, dissect the involvement of dopaminergic signaling in this regulation of
sleep, and discover the cellular locus of miR-190's role in homeostasis. First, I will identify the
molecular targets of miR-190 by performing of Ago-IP RNAseq and validate those by means of behavioral
experiments. Additionally, I will pursue the bases of miR-190 adult phenotype and its regulation by
dopaminergic signaling. I will study the morphology of DA cells in these miR-190-deficient genotypes to
determine if their sleep phenotype is caused by changes in cell number or connectivity. By using genetically
encoded functional CaLexA imaging sensor I will look at the activity of DA cells in miR-190 hypomorph flies
and determine if they are hyperactive, compared to control flies. Lastly, I will characterize miR-190's
spatiotemporal pattern of expression for sleep homeostasis regulation by expressing a miR-190 sponge in
brain areas known to affect sleep homeostasis and designing a miR-190 sensor capable of reading out miR-
190 levels. These experiments will shine light on the role of miRs in modulation of sleep and will be critical
for the understanding of normal sleep, as well as pathological sleep conditions.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RIVERA-RODRIGUEZ, EMMANUEL J.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01MH120228</grantId><grantName>Multiple mechanisms of neural coordination for associative memory processes</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2010558.0</amount><startDate>2019-07-01</startDate><endDate>2024-04-30</endDate><keyword>Animals, driving, Automobile Driving, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Choice Behavior, Communication, Cues, Decision Making, Disease, Disorder, Electrodes, Feedback, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Learning, Maintenance, Memory, Short-Term Memory, Immediate Memory, Shortterm Memory, working memory, Methods, Odors, olfactory bulb, Periodicity, Cyclicity, Rhythmicity, Physiology, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Rewards, Role, social role, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Schizophrenia, Sleep, Testing, Time, Work, Mediating, Prefrontal Cortex, density, Site, Phase, Physiologic, Physiological, Link, insight, Stimulus, tool, Cognitive Disturbance, Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive decline, Cognitive function abnormal, Disturbance in cognition, cognitive dysfunction, cognitive loss, Impaired cognition, cognitive function, Pattern, Techniques, System, behavior prediction, behavioral prediction, Performance, neural, memory process, memory processing, memory recall, Cognitive deficits, cognitive defects, novel, Brain region, Address, Symptoms, autism spectrum disorder, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Early Infantile Autism, Infantile Autism, Kanner's Syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, Detection, Retrieval, Monitor, Behavioral, Behavioral Paradigm, Population, neuromechanism, neural mechanism, loss of function, gain of function, optogenetics, cognitive ability, behavioral outcome, behavior outcome, neuropsychiatric disorder, neuropsychiatric disease, common symptom, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments,</keyword><description>Project Summary/ Abstract
Core cognitive functions involving memory are known to emerge as a result of coordination of activity at the
level of neural populations across distributed networks in the brain. Although neural coordination is known to
be involved in cognitive function, we lack a complete understanding of physiological mechanisms that mediate
coordination and temporal patterns, and whether this coordination can be targeted at the systems-level to
impact cognitive function. We aim to address this challenge by dissecting physiological mechanisms of long-
range coordination in two key brain regions important for memory-guided behavior, the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex. We will use an associative memory task that utilizes odor-place associations in a spatial
maze to investigate the role of rhythmic network oscillations and temporally patterned ensemble activity in
coordinating the hippocampal-prefrontal network. We have found that multiple brain rhythms are prominent in
these regions during recall, online maintenance, and formation of associative memories; and we will test the
novel hypothesis that the same core memory networks are dynamically engaged by distinct rhythms for
coordination during different memory processes. Further, we will directly manipulate this coordination using
real-time feedback methods in loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We have established the relevant
expertise to carry out this approach by combining high-density recordings during behavior with real-time
detection of network patterns and closed-loop feedback using electrical and optogenetic stimulation. First, we
will use multisite recording to simultaneously monitor ensemble activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex, as well as activity in the olfactory bulb, in rats as they retrieve learned odor cue-place associations to
guide behavioral choices for reward. We will investigate how distinct rhythms, namely beta oscillations (15-30
Hz) and theta oscillations (6-10 Hz), mediate coordination of these networks during memory recall and for
online maintenance during working memory respectively. We will further determine how oscillation phase-
entrained activity of hippocampal and prefrontal populations underlies communication to support these memory
processes, and use decoding techniques to investigate how temporally coordinated ensemble activity mediates
associative memories. Next, we will causally test the role of rhythmic patterns in memory using real-time
detection and closed-loop feedback for optogenetically manipulating hippocampal-prefrontal coordination at
specific phases of prevalent oscillations. In particular, we will test if perturbing or enhancing activity at preferred
phases for communication disrupts or enhances memory function respectively. Finally, we will use these
physiology and causal manipulation approaches to test the role of reactivation during sharp-wave ripples (150-
250 Hz) in formation of novel associations and driving coordination during learning. This proposal will thus
provide crucial insight in the role of oscillatory network activity in hippocampal-prefrontal coordination for
associative memory, and provide novel tools for impacting cognitive function by manipulating this coordination.</description><investigator><investigatorId>JADHAV, SHANTANU P</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM126303</grantId><grantName>How does a metallofactor in Hepatitis B viral protein X orchestrate pathogenesis and liver cancer</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1406862.0</amount><startDate>2019-07-05</startDate><endDate>2024-06-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Anti-Cancer Agents, Antineoplastic Drugs, Antineoplastics, Cancer Drug, Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents, Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents, anti-cancer drug, anticancer agent, anticancer drug, Antineoplastic Agents, driving, Automobile Driving, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cell physiology, Half-Cystine, L-Cysteine, Cysteine, Disease, Disorder, Disulfides, Electron Transport, electron transfer, Genotype, Goals, Hepatitis B, Viral Hepatitis B, serum hepatitis, Primary carcinoma of the liver cells, Hepatocarcinoma, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Hepatocellular cancer, Hepatoma, Liver Cells Carcinoma, liver carcinoma, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Human, Modern Man, Ligands, Liver, hepatic body system, hepatic organ system, Metalloproteins, Methods, Molecular Conformation, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Stereochemistry, conformation, conformational, conformational state, conformationally, conformations, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Oxidation-Reduction, Redox, oxidation reduction reaction, Play, Protein Conformation, Proteins, Research, Role, social role, Solubility, Testing, Time, Translating, Viral Gene Products, Viral Gene Proteins, virus protein, Viral Proteins, Virus, Generations, Mediating, Glean, Sequence Deletion, protein folding, cofactor, Clinical, biologic, Biological, Physiologic, Physiological, Link, Chemicals, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, Binding Proteins, Fe element, Iron, scaffolding, scaffold, Hepatic Cancer, liver cancer, liver malignancy, malignant liver tumor, Malignant neoplasm of liver, Nature, Knowledge, Location, Viral, cellular targeting, trafficking, Structure, Pathogenesis, response, protein protein interaction, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Etiology, Causality, causation, disease causation, protein structure, protein structures, proteins structure, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, Cirrhosis, cirrhotic, Pathway interactions, pathway, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, tumorigenic, innovation, innovate, innovative, Oncogenic, novel therapeutics, new drug treatments, new drugs, new therapeutics, new therapy, next generation therapeutics, novel drug treatments, novel drugs, novel therapy, Hepatitis B Virus, HBV, Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus, chronic infection, persistent infection,</keyword><description>Project Summary
 Chronic infection by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of human cancer worldwide, and is
strongly associated with development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 17-kDa HBx protein
of HBV is a causative tumorigenic agent and affects multiple cellular processes, either on its own or together
with the proteins it targets. Though the oncogenic potential of HBx has been demonstrated, neither its structure
nor the molecular mechanisms by which it mediates liver-associated diseases are known. The major obstacles
have been the sparing solubility, lack of significant homology to characterized proteins and intrinsic disorder. Our
studies have succeeded in obtaining HBx in highly soluble forms and for the first time shown that HBx is an [Fe-
S]-binding protein. Our long-term goal is to establish the chemical nature of the cofactor and its involvement in
driving protein conformation and reactivities, ultimately translating this molecular and structural knowledge to
HBxs’ extended functional repertoire. Our central hypothesis is that the [Fe-S] cluster is a common feature of
HBxs across all genotypes. We propose that the [Fe-S] cofactor confers structure in an otherwise disordered
protein and modulates protein reactivity and interactions by (at least) three distinct pathways: a) protein-protein
interactions, by changing the oligomeric or conformational status of HBx, b) redox mechanisms involving either
i) electron transfer processes to cofactors of target proteins or ii) regulatory processes as a response to cellular
redox status and generation of ROS, c) Fe- or [Fe-S]- transfer mechanisms, by which HBx can act as a scaffold
for iron-trafficking to regulate iron homeostasis and downstream molecular pathways. Our specific aims will test
these hypotheses by: (Aim 1) establishing the biologically relevant form of the cofactor, and if both observed
[4Fe] (stable) and [2Fe] (transient) forms are physiologically relevant. We will identify the cluster ligands, cysteine
residues likely involved in disulfides and examine how clinical mutations and large sequence deletions may affect
the cofactor and thus HBx function. (Aim 2) Establish the type, location and effects of the [Fe-S] cluster on the
protein structure (disorder-to-order transition) and whether cluster incorporation drives protein folding. If
successful, this step will set the stage for solving by solution NMR methods the highly sought structure of HBx,
either on its own or together with cellular binding partners. (Aim 3) Establish a link between the type and redox
form of the [Fe-S] cofactor and HBx biological activity. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal
is that it will fundamentally advance our understanding of HBx on the molecular and structural level, which is
currently missing. Because HBx is a potential target for the development of anti-cancer drugs, determining the
role(s) of the [Fe-S] cofactor and the linked structure/function relationships, will glean its part in viral-induced
pathogenesis and offer new therapeutic avenues.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PANDELIA, MARIA-EIRINI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21MH118464</grantId><grantName>Maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory synapse balance by ciliary signaling</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>446875.0</amount><startDate>2019-06-13</startDate><endDate>2021-04-30</endDate><keyword>experimental study, post-natal development, postnatal development, Cyclic AMP, 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP, Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate, Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate, Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate), adenosine 3'5' monophosphate, cAMP, Adenylate Cyclase, 3,5 cyclic AMP synthetase, Adenyl Cyclase, Adenylyl Cyclase, adenylcyclase, Adult, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Amines, amine, Behavior Disorders, behavioral disorder, Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Biology, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cells, Cell Body, Cilia, Cognition Disorders, cognitive disease, cognitive disorder, cognitive syndrome, Complement, Complement Proteins, Disease, Disorder, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptiform, epileptogenic, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Goals, Maintenance, Mental Health, Mental Hygiene, Psychological Health, Metabolic Diseases, Metabolic Disorder, Thesaurismosis, metabolism disorder, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, Nervous system structure, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Neuronal Plasticity, CNS plasticity, central nervous system plasticity, neural plasticity, neuroplastic, neuroplasticity, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neuropeptides, Organelles, Physiology, Role, social role, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Signal Pathway, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Testing, Work, Measures, Mediating, homotypical cortex, isocortex, neopallium, Neocortex, base, density, Area, Acute, Adolescent Youth, juvenile, juvenile human, Adolescent, Neuropeptide Receptor, Link, insight, Individual, Dysfunction, Physiopathology, pathophysiology, Functional disorder, Morphology, postnatal, Sensory, cell type, Receptor Protein, receptor, synapse formation, synaptogenesis, neuronal circuit, neuronal circuitry, Structure, novel, G Protein-Complex Receptor, G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes, GPCR, G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, intervention therapy, Therapeutic Intervention, neurogenesis, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Regulation, Property, response, CNS Nervous System, Central Nervous System, Neuraxis, Neuromodulator, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Early Infantile Autism, Infantile Autism, Kanner's Syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Inhibitory Synapse, in vivo, Cilium Microtubule, Excitatory Synapse, Neuronal Differentiation, Signaling Molecule, Process, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, neuronal excitability, migration, Coupled, neocortical, synapse function, synaptic function, progenitor, public health relevance, ciliopathy, neuropsychiatric disease, neuropsychiatric disorder, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description> Primary cilia are sensory organelles that are now known to be present on nearly every neuron type
in the mammalian central nervous system. In the developing nervous system, cilia are essential for
progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, and the establishment of synaptic connectivity. However,
although cilia are also present on mature neurons, their roles in the postnatal brain are poorly understood.
Intriguingly, cilia concentrate neuropeptide and amine receptors, and cilia dysfunction has been linked with
multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, suggesting that cilia-dependent neuromodulator signaling may be
critical for the maintenance and plasticity of neural circuits. The overall goal of this exploratory R21 is to
investigate the role of ciliary signaling in the acute modulation of excitatory synapse formation and function
in the postnatal brain.
 In preliminary experiments, we have found that acute disruption of cilia in postnatal cortical neurons
increases excitatory synapse number and strength. Consistent with this finding, spontaneous neuronal firing
rates (driven by synaptic input) are also increased indicating a disruption of excitation/inhibition (E/I)
balance. Since E/I imbalance contributes to multiple neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders, our results
raise the novel and exciting possibility that ciliary signaling is essential for generating and maintaining
correct E/I balance in multiple postnatal circuits. We will take advantage of the complementary expertise of
the co-PIs (Sengupta – cilia biology, Turrigiano – synaptic physiology) to:
 Aim 1. Establish a role for ciliary signaling in the regulation of E/I balance and circuit excitability.
 Aim 2. Explore the mechanisms by which ciliary signaling modulates synaptic properties.
 Results from this work have the potential to open up new avenues for understanding how correct E/I
balance is dynamically maintained in the postnatal brain, and provide insights into how cilia dysfunction
contributes to the regulation of mental health.</description><investigator><investigatorId>SENGUPTA, PIALI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1917671</grantId><grantName>The Interaction of Warfare and Agricultural Intensification</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>177504.0</amount><startDate>2019-06-01</startDate><endDate>2022-05-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Golden, Charles</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1900560</grantId><grantName>Asymptotic vs. Uniform Approximation in Dynamical Systems and Number Theory</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>223000.0</amount><startDate>2019-07-01</startDate><endDate>2022-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Kleinbock, Dmitry</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>MT26390819</grantId><grantName>MAPPING RELIGIOUS TRANSFORMATION IN BOSTON'S HIDDEN SACRED SPACES</grantName><funderCode>418</funderCode><funderAgency>National Endowment for the Humanities</funderAgency><amount>100000.0</amount><startDate>2019-01-01</startDate><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>HAA26380019</grantId><grantName>MEASURING POLYPHONY: AN ONLINE MUSIC EDITOR FOR LATE MEDIEVAL POLYPHONY</grantName><funderCode>418</funderCode><funderAgency>National Endowment for the Humanities</funderAgency><amount>42478.7</amount><startDate>2019-03-01</startDate><endDate>2020-12-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35NS111562</grantId><grantName>Mechanisms and Function of Firing Rate Homeostasis in Cortical Circuits</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4020918.0</amount><startDate>2019-05-01</startDate><endDate>2027-04-30</endDate><keyword>Animals, Dorsum, Back, Disease, Disorder, Endowment, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptogenic, Feedback, Goals, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Learning, Memory, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Research Support, Role, social role, PTSD, Post-Traumatic Neuroses, Posttraumatic Neuroses, post-trauma stress disorder, posttrauma stress disorder, traumatic neurosis, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, Work, homotypical cortex, isocortex, neopallium, Neocortex, Individual, tool, Nature, programs, Investigation, Sensory, experience, Property, Central Nervous System, CNS Nervous System, Neuraxis, prevent, preventing, autism spectrum disorder, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Early Infantile Autism, Infantile Autism, Kanner's Syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, in vivo, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, Pyramidal neuron, neocortical, memory encoding,</keyword><description>The overall goal of my NS-supported research program is to understand the mechanisms that
stabilize the function of central nervous system (CNS) microcircuits during experience-
dependent plasticity and learning. Over the past ~20 years of NS support we discovered and
characterized several forms of homeostatic plasticity, including synaptic scaling and intrinsic
homeostatic plasticity, that are postulated to sense perturbations in mean neuronal activity,
then bidirectionally adjust synaptic and cellular properties to keep activity within a set point
range. Our recent work has focused on a) identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
these homeostatic forms of plasticity in order to bolster our mechanistic and functional
understanding, and to generate tools that allow us to selectively block homeostatic plasticity in
vivo; and b) to determine what aspect of neuronal activity is under homeostatic control in intact
CNS circuits in vivo. We recently showed that the mean firing rates of neocortical pyramidal
neurons in freely behaving animals return back to an individual baseline following prolonged
perturbations to sensory drive, strongly supporting the idea that neocortical neurons
homeostatically regulate their mean firing around an individual 'firing rate set point'. Such a
process is theoretically important for preventing circuit hypo- or hyperexcitability during
experience-dependent development, as well as to short-circuit the positive feedback nature of
Hebbian plasticity rules that can degrade memory fidelity. We now have (or are developing) the
tools to disrupt homeostatic plasticity and firing rate set points in vivo, allowing us to assess the
impact of this disruption on network function and memory storage. The major goals of my NS-
supported research program going forward are: 1) to determine how activity set points are built,
and how individual neurons can have set points that are orders of magnitude different from each
other; 2) to understand how multiple homeostatic mechanisms cooperate with each other to
stabilize network activity in the face of profound perturbations; and 3) to test the role of
synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in memory encoding and generalization.
These studies will have important implications for our understanding of neurological disorders
that arise from aberrant circuit excitability (epilepsy, autism-spectrum disorders). They may
also provide a new avenue into understanding disorders such as PTSD that are likely to arise
from excessive generalization during aversive learning.</description><investigator><investigatorId>TURRIGIANO, GINA G</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM130842</grantId><grantName>Molecular and cellular determinants of Drosophila larva thermotaxis</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2144793.0</amount><startDate>2019-03-15</startDate><endDate>2024-01-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Anatomy, Anatomic, Anatomic Sites, Anatomic structures, Anatomical Sciences, Animals, Automobile Driving, driving, Behavior, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cells, Cell Body, Cues, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Elements, Family, Goals, Interneurons, Connector Neuron, Intercalary Neuron, Intercalated Neurons, Internuncial Cell, Internuncial Neuron, Larva, Maps, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Nervous system structure, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Neurosciences, Odors, Olfactory system, olfactory circuitry, olfactory circuits, Olfactory Pathways, Physiology, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, social role, Role, Olfaction, Smell, odor perception, olfactory perception, Smell Perception, Stereotyped Behavior, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Taste Perception, Temperature, Testing, temperature receptor, Thermoreceptors, Transducers, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, genetic manipulation, gene manipulation, genetically manipulate, genetically perturb, Organ, sensor, Dorsal, Peripheral, Area, Physiological, Physiologic, Chemicals, insight, Stimulus, Individual, Collaborations, Genetic, Shapes, tool, cognitive function, Investigation, Complex, Sensory, Texture, System, mutant, Receptor Protein, receptor, sensory mechanism, sensory integration, Modality, lobes, Lobe, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, methods to study multiple-level influences, multi-level analysis, multi-level model, multilevel model, multilevel modeling, multilevel analysis, Property, response, Brain region, Address, Data, Resolution, in vivo, Molecular, Process, Behavioral, Image, imaging, Output, feeding, Interneuron function, information processing, multisensory, flexibility, flexible, in vivo imaging, imaging in vivo, behavioral response, behavior response, differential expression, differentially expressed, transcriptional differences, sensory input, connectome,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Molecular and cellular determinants of Drosophila larva thermotaxis
How nervous systems detect and integrate multiple sensory cues to generate robust behaviors is a major
question in neuroscience. Such integration is particularly salient in thermosensing, as animals are frequently
required to integrate input from multiple thermoreceptor classes. Temperature's ubiquity also means input from
other modalities (e.g., olfaction) is commonly received in the context of ongoing thermosensory stimulation.
Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying the integration
of information from multiple sensors remains a challenge. We will address this challenge in the Drosophila
larva. Its ease of genetic manipulation, synaptic-resolution connectome of thermosensory and olfactory
processing areas, amenability to neuronal imaging, and stereotyped behaviors, all make it a favorable system
for a comprehensive molecular and circuit level investigation of the mechanisms of sensory integration. We
propose to achieve these goals in three aims:
Aim 1) Establish the molecular and cellular receptors that provide thermosensory input
In aims 1.a. and 1.b., we will identify the molecular basis of thermosensing by thermosensory neurons in the
larval Dorsal Organ and examine their roles in guiding behavior through cell-specific inhibition and activation
combined with high-resolution behavioral analysis.
Aim 2) Probe the activities of the interneurons that process thermosensory input
In aim 2.a., we will examine how thermosensory inputs act to modulate the neuronal activity of individually
identifiable downstream projection neurons revealed from the larval antennal lobe connectome. This will
establish the manner in which peripheral sensory input influences these second-order interneurons. In aim
2.b., we will investigate how thermosensory and olfactory systems interact in multi-sensory integration of
chemical and thermal cues.
Aim 3) Probe the functions of the interneurons that process thermosensory input
In aim 3, we will determine the contribution of each projection neuron to thermotactic navigation through cell-
specific inhibition and activation of individual PNs combined with high-resolution behavioral analysis.
Taken together, these studies combine molecular genetics, physiology, and high resolution behavioral
analyses to perform a comprehensive analysis of how this relatively small neural circuit processes multiple,
distinct sensory inputs to control robust and flexible behaviors.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32GM131541</grantId><grantName>In vitro reconstitution and in vivo dissection of dynamic actin cables</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>61610.0</amount><startDate>2019-04-01</startDate><endDate>2020-03-31</endDate><keyword>Actins, Affect, Alzheimer's Disease, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Architecture, Engineering / Architecture, Back, Dorsum, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, malignant breast neoplasm, malignant breast tumor, Breast Cancer, Cell Compartmentations, Cell Compartmentation, Cell Body, Cells, intracellular skeleton, Cytoskeletal System, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeleton, Dissection, Endomycetales, Budding Yeast, Saccharomycetales, Goals, In Vitro, Photoradiation, Light, Illumination, Lighting, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, COPD, Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease, Reticulolymphosarcoma, Malignant Lymphoma, Germinoblastoma, Germinoblastic Sarcoma, Lymphoma, Myofilaments, Actin Filaments, Microfilaments, Microscopy, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, Morphogenesis, Mothers, tumor cell metastasis, cancer metastasis, Secondary Tumor, Secondary Neoplasm, Metastatic Tumor, Metastatic Neoplasm, Metastatic Mass, Metastatic Lesion, Metastasize, Metastasis, Neoplasm Metastasis, Polymers, Proteins, Public Health, Research, social role, Role, S. cerevisiae, S cerevisiae, Brewer's Yeast, Baker's Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Testing, Tropomyosin, Work, Yeasts, calponin, cofilin, Fimbrin, profilin, Dissociation, coronin, Crnlp protein, coronin protein, Point Mutation, crosslink, cross-link, Label, Biological, Link, Binding Proteins, bound protein, Protein Binding, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Ligand Binding Protein, Confocal Microscopy, Genetic, polymerization, Shapes, Dimerization, Protein Dimerization, Complex, System, S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP, monomer, mutant, self organization, Structure, novel, genetic regulatory protein, regulatory gene product, Regulatory Protein, Regulation, Biomimetics, Biological Mimetics, single molecule, Barbed End of the Actin Filament, Plus End of the Actin Filament, Thickness, Thick, Address, Length, Crosslinker, Data, Resolution, in vivo, Filament, Characteristics, Molecular, Image, imaging, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy, TIRF Microscopy, Bundling, daughter cell, protein crosslink, reconstitution, reconstitute, interdisciplinary approach, multidisciplinary approach, Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor, pediatric brain cancer, childhood brain cancer, Pediatric Malignant Brain Tumor, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR, Genetic study, live cell imaging, live cellular imaging, live cellular image, live cell image,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The goal of this research is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of biological self-organization, focusing on the
rules that govern dynamics and organization of cellular actin structures. This question will be addressed using
as a model system the polarized actin cables assembled in budding yeast. The proposal seeks to understand
how 8-10 different conserved actin-regulatory proteins, each with a distinct functional role, work in concert to
polymerize, stabilize, bundle, and dynamically turnover actin cables, endowing these structures with a
characteristic length, architecture, and dynamics. The project combines in vitro reconstitution, genetics, live-cell
imaging, multi-wavelength single molecule TIRF microscopy, structured illumination microscopy, and 4D

Tuberculosis kills over 1 million people a year, and an increasing percentage of these cases
involves bacteria that are resistant to all front line and many second line therapies. New drugs
and new drug targets are needed to combat the relentless evolution of resistance. We have
discovered a scaffold, which we designate Q, that has potent in vitro antibacterial activity
against Mtb. These compounds are active in macrophage infections and do not display host
cell cytotoxicity. Some Q compounds inhibit the essential enzyme inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase 2 (MtbIMPDH2), but other closely related compounds engage an unknown
target. Multi-target antibiotics have a greatly diminished risk of developing resistance than
single target compounds, so the observation that the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of
MtbIMPDH2 inhibition overlaps with inhibition of another essential enzyme is exciting. Indeed,
we have as yet been unable to generate strains that are resistant to these compounds. Here
we propose to further interrogate the SAR of antimycobacterial activity and to identify the
unknown target using a multi-pronged approach. These experiments will lay the foundation for
the development of multitarget antibiotics that will be “resistance-resistant”.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HEDSTROM, LIZBETH K.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AG061886</grantId><grantName>Influence of Culture on Learning and Decision Making with Age</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2221994.0</amount><startDate>2019-03-01</startDate><endDate>2023-12-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, ages, Age, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Elderly, Aging, AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Chinese American, Cognition, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Decision Making, Exhibits, Recording of previous events, History, histories, Learning, Memory, Mission, Neuropsychology, Neuropsychologies, neuropsychologic, Pathologic Processes, Pathological Processes, Pathology, Public Health, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Risk Taking, Formosa, Republic of China, Taiwan, temporal cortex, Temporal Lobe, Testing, Time, Work, Measures, Medial, Area, Memory Deficit, memory dysfunction, Memory impairment, Individual, adult youth, young adulthood, young adult, Collaborations, Shapes, Age-associated cognitive decline, Age-related cognitive decline, Benign senescent forgetfulness, age associated memory decline, age related cognitive deficit, age related cognitive impairment, age related memory dysfunction, Age-associated memory impairment, Functional MRI, fMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Life, programs, Pattern, Techniques, System, Equation, age group, American, Performance, cohort, neural, Structure, memory process, memory processing, neuroimaging, neuro-imaging, neurological imaging, novel, Participant, research study, cultural values, neural circuit, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, Modeling, Sampling, Behavior assessment, behavioral assessment, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Brain region, Address, Data, Qualifying, Process, follow-up, Active Follow-up, active followup, follow up, followed up, followup, Behavioral, age related, age dependent, age effect, aging effect, pathological aging, Cognitive aging, protective effect, Impairment, ethnic minority population, ethnic minority group, ethnic minority individual, ethnic minority people, normal aging, flexibility, flexible, mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive disorder, rate of change, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, predictive test, predictive assay, East Asian, Chinese,</keyword><description>The effects of aging are largely assumed to be universal across different cultures. Few studies test this assumption
of universality, with some revealing cross-cultural differences in cognition with age. The proposed research will
assess how culture (American/Taiwan) and cultural values (collectivism/independence) affect cognitive aging by
comparing younger and older adults across cultures using behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) measures. The
research program will employ longitudinal measures, assessing behavior and brain changes in the same individuals
after a 3 year follow-up. Longitudinal approaches are important to establish that differences between extreme age
groups (e.g., 20 vs. 70 year olds) reflect effects of aging rather than other potential cohort differences. Even
longitudinal follow-up periods as short as a few years are sufficient to identify declines in performance or the volume
of some brain regions, though less work has investigated effects of aging on functional brain activity longitudinally.
Moreover, longitudinal measures may have sensitivity to identify exaggerated declines in aging, which could indicate
pathological processes associated with aging, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
That is, older adults who show poorer levels of performance on neuropsychological, decision making, or memory
tasks at time 1 may show more pronounced decline at time 2, compared to those older adults performing at higher
levels. Pronounced decline over time may serve as a marker of pathological aging (e.g., MCI or AD). The tasks
selected for this research have shown promise in detecting dysfunctional patterns of aging; we will further test
whether the markers are equally sensitive across cultures. Although both decision making and memory abilities can
be affected by aging, the selected tasks engage largely complementary systems, with value-based decision making
relying on frontostriatal systems and memory processes engaging medial temporal regions. One framework
suggests that these systems differ in their vulnerability to pathological aging processes (e.g., AD) such that the
frontostriatal systems largely reflect typical aging processes whereas AD disproportionately impacts temporo-
parietal regions. We can test this model in the proposed research by studying decision making and memory
processes across younger and older adults longitudinally, extending the model across cultures. The proposed
research will address three major questions: 1) how do culture and cultural values contribute to value-based
decision-making with age, 2) does aging consistently impact explicit memory across cultures, and 3) to what
extent do cultural differences in decision making and memory generalize from cross-sectional to longitudinal
(within-participant) measures of aging. This research will be led by two researchers with a history of collaboration
who have established lines of aging research in the US (Gutchess) and Taiwan (Goh). Furthermore, the PIs areas of
research expertise are complementary, with Dr. Goh’s lab investigating effects of age and culture and decision
making and Dr. Gutchess’ lab focused on effects of age and culture on memory.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GUTCHESS, ANGELA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R56NS109916</grantId><grantName>Maladaptive compensatory plasticity in developing cortical circuits</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>406250.0</amount><startDate>2019-01-01</startDate><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword>Age, ages, Animals, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain Diseases, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Brain Disorders, Nucleus, Cell Nucleus, Cell Body, Cells, Chromatin, Disorder, Disease, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Epilepsy, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, Exhibits, Gene Expression, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Interneurons, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Methods, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Mus, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Proteins, Rats Mammals, Rat, Common Rat Strains, Rattus, Risk, Seizures, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, Transcription factor genes, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, General Transcription Factors, General Transcription Factor Gene, Basal transcription factor genes, Basal Transcription Factor, transcription factor, Transcription, RNA Expression, Gene Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Upregulation, Up-Regulation, Family member, Neocortex, neopallium, isocortex, homotypical cortex, improved, Site, Chronic, Physiological, Physiologic, Financial compensation, Compensation, Individual, Recovery, cell type, Intellectual functioning disability, intellectual and developmental disability, Intellectual limitation, Intellectual disability, Structure, novel, Gene Expression Profiling, transcriptional profiling, gene expression assay, gene expression analysis, Transcript Expression Analysis, Transcript Expression Analyses, Gene Expression Pattern Analysis, Gene Expression Monitoring, response, deprivation, developmental disease, developmental disorder, Transcriptional Control, Transcription Regulation, Transcriptional Regulation, preventing, prevent, Address, autism spectrum disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autistic Disorder, Autism, Global Change, Inhibitory Synapse, in vivo, Epigenetic Process, Epigenetic Mechanism, Epigenetic Change, Epigenetic, Excitatory Synapse, Slice, Monitor, Knock-out, Knockout, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, Pyramidal neuron, excitatory neuron, inhibitory neuron, design, designing, neocortical, overexpression, overexpress, critical period, Array tomography, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, single-cell RNA sequencing, single cell RNA-seq, scRNA-seq,</keyword><description>Developmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorders and Intellectual Disability can lead to
reduced cortical activity. Paradoxically, these same disorders also greatly increase the risk for developing
seizures. Homeostatic plasticity compensates for reduced activity by increasing overall gain within cortical
circuits. But these normally beneficial mechanisms can have maladaptive effects, especially during critical
periods of circuit formation. For example, activity blockade in vivo in rat or mouse neocortex, induces seizures,
but only if deprivation is prolonged and occurs early. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying this
Maladaptive Compensatory Plasticity (MCP) in neocortical slice culture. Activity blockade qualitatively
changes network activity, and changes persist when activity is restored. There is a dramatic shift in the balance
between excitation and inhibition following early, but not later deprivation. In contrast, changes in cellular
excitability occur at both ages. Aim 1 will identify the critical physiological features of MCP, that separate it from
normal homeostatic plasticity. By blocking activity in single neurons, and varying the timing of activity blockade,
we will distinguish cell autonomous from network effects, and determine which are critical for persistent MCP.
Using Array Tomography and paired recording, we ask whether induction of MCP alters the number of
functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Aims 2 and 3 examine the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of MCP. In Aim 2 we develop the
novel idea of push/pull transcriptional regulation of homeostatic plasticity. We identify a pair of closely related
transcription factors (TFs) that are potently and progressively upregulated during blockade of activity.
Intriguingly, these TFs are part of a pathway that opposes compensatory plasticity, since compensatory
responses are exaggerated when they are knocked out. Finally, in Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that MCP is
driven by a lasting change in the chromatin accessibility of cortical neurons. Together these studies may
identify new strategies for mitigating maladaptive consequences of normally beneficial plasticity mechanisms.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NELSON, SACHA

bound vesicles that transport cargoes such as
proteins, RNA, DNA, and lipids between cells. EVs are universally released from tissues within the
body, and trafficking of EVs within the nervous system is important for cell-cell communication. EVs
can also contribute to the disposal or spread of pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease,
making understanding the biology of EV regulation within the nervous system highly relevant to
human health. Our knowledge of EV biology is primarily based on studies carried out using in vitro or
cell culture-based systems. While these studies have identified a number of important molecular
players that are likely involved in these processes, the molecular mechanisms driving EV cargo
uptake by target cells, in a complex, in vivo nervous system remains unstudied. The Drosophila NMJ
was the first system to study in vivo trafficking of EV cargoes, and our lab has developed novel tools
to track endogenously labeled, neuronally derived EV cargoes as they get transferred to and taken up
by the postsynaptic muscle cell. This level of detail within an in vivo complex nervous system cannot
be attained in another system, and when combined with its genetic tractability, amenability to
imaging, and available cell-biological, and tissue specific manipulations, the Drosophila NMJ is the
ideal model system with which to ask direct questions about EV cargo uptake mechanisms. Using this
system, we have identified a role for the Drosophila membrane-remodeling protein Amphiphysin in
the regulation of postsynaptic EV cargo distribution. The goal of this proposal is to determine how
Amph contributes to EV cargo uptake in vivo, and to define the cell-biological pathways that regulate
EV cargo uptake in vivo in a complex nervous system. This is particularly intriguing because in
humans, mutations in Amphiphysin-2/BIN1 are a very strong genetic risk factor for late onset
Alzheimer's disease, and disruption of EV cargo trafficking is implicated in neurodegenerative
disease. Together, this makes defining the mechanisms of Amph in EV cargo uptake, and how these
are regulated at the cell-biological level, critical for understanding how Amph, and EV cargo uptake
may contribute to neurological disease processes. Carrying out the experiments outlined in this
proposal will provide me with training in high resolution microscopy, quantitative image analysis, cell-
biological manipulations, and advanced Drosophila genetics. Furthermore, it includes concrete plans
to enhance my training in leadership, mentorship, the responsible conduct of research, and scientific
communication. Together, training in these areas will prepare me to become an independent
scientist.</description><investigator><investigatorId>BLANCHETTE, CASSANDRA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R24MH114678</grantId><grantName>Data interface and apps for systems neurophysiology and imaging</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>761355.0</amount><startDate>2018-09-10</startDate><endDate>2022-08-31</endDate><keyword>Adoption, Astronomy, space science, Axon, Boston, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain Diseases, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Brain Disorders, Calcium, Communities, computer programming, computer program, Computers, data interpretation, Data Analysis, Data Analyses, Data Collection, Future, Goals, Modern Man, Human, Laboratories, Language, Learning, Libraries, Photoradiation, Light, literacy, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, neurophysiological, neurophysiology, Neurosciences, Programming Languages, Publishing, Reading, Records, Researchers, Investigators, Research Personnel, taste response, taste processing, gustatory response, gustatory processing, gustatory perception, Taste, Gustation, Taste Perception, Technology, Testing, Time, Translating, Work, Writing, Dataset, Data Set, Custom, Microscope, improved, Procedures, Specific qualifier value, Specified, Series, Pythons, Ensure, Intuition, Stimulus, Discipline, Databases, data base, Data Bases, Collaborations, tool, instrument, programs, Scientist, Hour, Event, Source, System, interest, data management, experience, central pattern generator, voltage, relating to nervous system, neural, Funding Agency, Funding Source, graduate student, literate, new technology, novel technologies, Devices, Sorting - Cell Movement, sorting, Code, Coding System, Property, portability, Documentation, Data, Reader, Reproducibility, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, Image, imaging, Metadata, meta data, two-photon, 2-photon, computer code, digital, data integration, design, designing, Population, data acquisition, file format, user-friendly, open source, data exchange, data transmission, data sharing, BRAIN initiative, Scientific Inquiry, data access, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, imaging program, data pipeline,</keyword><description> Technology for recording from the brain is developing at a breakneck pace. But the digital
integration of data acquired from different recording technologies is an impediment to the rapid
adoption of these technologies across labs, and also makes analysis by interested 3rd parties, such
as theorists, difficult. This lack of integration is a major barrier to scientific inquiry, as labs cannot
easily analyze each other's data. Funding agencies are increasingly concerned with reproducibility,
rigor, and distribution of data, even though there is no generally accepted “library” process for sharing
these data. Common data interfaces would facilitate the development of common analysis code,
leading to an increase in code testing and robustness, and an increase in reproducibility and rigor.
 In this proposal, a data interface standard for neurophysiological and imaging data is
developed. The standard is not a file format but rather is a systematic means of specifying and
accessing data used in the neurosciences, including voltage waveforms, imaging data, spike times of
neurons, and intensity values in regions-of-interest within imaging data. Versions are developed in
Matlab and Python, but the data interface standard can be written in any programming language. The
proposal includes the development of file readers for several Multifunction Data Acquisition Devices,
2-photon microscopes, stimulus devices, and “apps” for imaging, spike, and stimulus analysis.
 The ease and power of the interface is tested in multiple data access events involving
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in neuroscience. Two of these sessions are reviewed
by an outside group with expertise in interface design and human factors. The standard is revised
after each session to improve ease and power.
 The proposal also includes the conversion of several data sets from a variety of systems
neuroscientists and modelers, including BRAIN researchers. These data sets include neural
recordings, laboratory stimuli, and behavioral data, and range from long-duration recordings of central
pattern generators, to long-duration recordings of cortical neurons, to studies of navigation and taste
perception. Conversion of these data sets will force the development team to ensure that these data
can be specified easily, and also provide a first group of data sets for other scientists or amateurs to
analyze.
 The long range goal is to enable experimentalists, theorists, and even amateurs to exchange
data easily and to begin meaningful analysis within the hour of download. This has the capability to
transform neuroscience into a discipline more like astronomy, where data is widely shared and many
theorists and amateurs contribute to new discoveries.</description><investigator><investigatorId>VAN HOOSER, STEPHEN D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F99CA234746</grantId><grantName>Overcoming Tumor Resistance with Enzyme-Instructed Nanoscale Assemblies and Immunotherapies</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>39453.06</amount><startDate>2018-09-07</startDate><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword>Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Western Blotting, protein blotting, Western Immunoblotting, Malignant Neoplasms, neoplasm/cancer, malignancy, Malignant Tumor, Cancers, Catalysis, necrocytosis, Cell Death, Cell Body, Cells, multi-modal treatment, multi-modal therapy, combined treatment, combined modality treatment, combination therapy, Multimodal Treatment, Multimodal Therapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Downregulation, Down-Regulation, resistant to Drug, resistance to Drug, drug resistant, Drug resistance, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Ergastoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, Exhibits, Goals, immuno therapy, immune-based treatments, immune-based therapies, immune therapy, immune therapeutic strategy, immune therapeutic regimens, immune therapeutic interventions, immune therapeutic approach, immune drugs, Immunologically Directed Therapy, Immunotherapy, Laboratories, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Patients, Proteins, Relapse, Research, Survival Rate, Testing, Time, Immunofluorescence, Immunofluorescence Immunologic, Treatment Failure, therapy failure, base, improved, Phase, Failure, insight, Confocal Microscopy, analog, chemical property, Research Project Grants, Research Projects, Research Grants, R01 Program, R01 Mechanism, R-Series Research Projects, cancer immunotherapy, immunotherapy of cancer, immunotherapy for cancer, anticancer immunotherapy, anti-cancer immunotherapy, Normal tissue morphology, Normal Tissue, cancer cell, Malignant Cell, Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure, cancer chemotherapy, Quimioterapia, Combination Chemotherapy Regimen, Chemotherapy, Cancer, General, Chemotherapy Regimen, Chemotherapy Protocol, Clinic, Techniques, System, biomaterial compatibility, biocompatibility, physical property, success, simulation, Prevention, response, drug development, Nanotechnology, nanotechnological, nanotech, nano-technological, nano technology, nano tech, preventing, prevent, nanomedicinal, nano medicine, nano medicinal, nanomedicine, small molecule, Address, Antitumor Response, anti-tumor response, Cancer Immunology Science, cancer immunology, resistance mechanism, resistant mechanism, self assembly, time use, anticancer research, cancer research, anti-cancer research, design, designing, nanoscale, nanometer sized, nanometer scale, nano scale, nano meter sized, nano meter scale, innovation, innovative, innovate, Resistance, resistant, post-doctoral training, postdoctoral training, chemotherapy, novel therapeutics, novel therapy, novel drugs, novel drug treatments, next generation therapeutics, new therapy, new therapeutics, new drugs, new drug treatments, loss of function, tumor, spatiotemporal, public health relevance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ER stress, molecular targeted therapies, molecular targeted treatment, molecular targeted therapeutics, acquired drug resistance, immune checkpoint blockade, immune check point blockade, checkpoint blockade, check point blockade, cancer drug resistance, resistant to cancer drugs, resistance to cancer drugs, anti-cancer, anticancer, side effect,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major problem facing
current cancer research. The development of drug resistance could lead to chemotherapy failure and
tumor relapse, resulting in reduced survival rates. In addition, despite the unprecedented success
achieved in cancer immunotherapy over the past decades, the cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms of
resistance result in low response rates of patients which remains a major challenge. Therefore, it is
urgently necessary to develop novel therapy to address these problems. Recently, our laboratory,
headed by my sponsor Dr. Bing Xu, developed anticancer nanomedicine based on enzyme-instructed
self-assembly (EISA). The EISA is capable of selective inhibition of tumor without harming normal
tissues due to its precise spatiotemporal control. Additionally, by targeting multiple targets, EISA hardly
induces acquired drug resistance. Most importantly, combination therapy holds great promise for tumor
prevention and treatment. The overall goal of this project is to overcome cancer drug resistance
through the application of nanotechnology and combination with anticancer immunotherapy. To achieve
this goal, we proposed two following specific aims:
 1) During the F99 phase, I propose to develop anticancer nanomedicines based on EISA to
target loss-of-function (downregulation) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cancer cells for minimizing
the drug resistance and side effect. We designed a two enzyme controlled assembly system to target
the downregulation via the combination of enzyme-instructed assembly and disassembly and tested its
anticancer efficacy and selectivity. We will also study the EISA in targeting ER for cancer inhibition. The
ER targeting ability and dynamic distribution of the designed molecules will be tested. Moreover, we
will elucidate the mechanisms of cancer cell death induced by ER targeting.
 2) For the K00, the direction of my postdoctoral research will focus on improving the anti-tumor
response of immunotherapy through the combination with EISA based nanomedicines. The proposed
postdoctoral training will provide me with new insight and techniques in cancer immunology.</description><investigator><investigatorId>FENG, ZHAOQIANQI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32GM130106</grantId><grantName>Control of Actin Assembly at the Leading Edge by the IQGAP-APC-Dia Triad</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>59038.0</amount><startDate>2019-01-01</startDate><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword>Actins, Affect, alpha Actin, α Actin, Amino Acids, aminoacid, cell motility, Cell Locomotion, Cell Migration, Cell Movement, Cellular Migration, Cellular Motility, Motility, Cells, Cell Body, Cytoskeleton, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeletal System, intracellular skeleton, Family, Grant, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases, GTP Phosphohydrolases, GTPases, Guanosinetriphosphatases, guanosinetriphosphatase, Health, Hela Cells, HeLa, Human, Modern Man, Human Development, Immunity, In Vitro, Kidney, Kidney Urinary System, renal, Kinetics, Lighting, Illumination, Lung, Lung Respiratory System, pulmonary, Actin Filaments, Myofilaments, Microfilaments, Microscopy, Micro-tubule, Microtubules, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Mutation, Metastasis, Metastasize, Metastatic Lesion, Metastatic Mass, Metastatic Neoplasm, Metastatic Tumor, Secondary Neoplasm, Secondary Tumor, cancer metastasis, tumor cell metastasis, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neurologic function, Neurological function, nervous system function, Nervous System Physiology, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Play, APC gene, APC - Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, APC Protein, APC genes, APC tumor suppressor, Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli Gene, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein, DP2.5, Proteins, Public Health, Role, social role, Science, Signal Pathway, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Testing, Work, rho, Triad Acrylic Resin, Triad, Triad resin, Mediating, Point Mutation, Tertiary Protein Structure, Peptide Domain, Protein Domains, density, tumor progression, cancer progression, neoplasm progression, neoplastic progression, Label, Biochemical, Link, insight, Collaborations, Genetic, Attenuated, scaffold, scaffolding, Knowledge, Complex, Location, mutant, stoichiometry, Structure, novel, Agreement, Regulation, Modeling, single molecule, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Quelling, RNA Silencing, RNAi, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNA Interference, cell cortex, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Plus End of the Microtubule, Growing End of the Microtubule, F-Actin, Filamentous Actin, Plus End of the Actin Filament, Barbed End of the Actin Filament, APC2 gene, APC2, APCL gene, APCL protein, adenomatosis polyposis coli 2, adenomatous polyposis coli like, Address, Length, Data, Resolution, in vivo, Scaffolding Protein, WNT Signaling Pathway, WNT signaling, Molecular, Process, Cardiac, Development, developmental, Colorectal Cancer, Colo-rectal Cancer, cellular imaging, cell imaging, molecular imaging, molecule imaging, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent, TIRF Microscopy, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy, C-terminal, human disease, new drug treatments, new drugs, new therapeutics, new therapy, next generation therapeutics, novel drug treatments, novel drugs, novel therapy, novel therapeutics, directional cell, spatiotemporal, in vitro activity, live cell imaging, live cell image, live cellular image, live cellular imaging, imaging genetics, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>Project Summary
 The precise spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge is critical for cell migration,
and many of the `players' (molecules) involved have been identified, including those involved in regulating actin
assembly to drive leading edge protrusion. However, many of the interacting components of this actin
assembly machinery (e.g., IQGAP, APC, and Formins) are large molecules with complex domain structures
and interactions, making them difficult to study. For this reason, there persists a fundamental gap in our
understanding of the molecular basis of actin assembly regulation at the leading edge.
 Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) localizes to the leading edge (Nathke et al., 1996, JCB), and recent
work from the Goode Lab has shown that a C-terminal domain in APC potently stimulates actin assembly in
vitro, in direct collaboration with formins, via a `Rocket Launcher' mechanism (Okada et al., 2010, JCB;
Breitsprecher et al., 2012, Science). Further, the Goode Lab used a powerful separation-of-function point
mutation in this domain to demonstrate that APC-mediated actin assembly is critical for directed cell migration
(Juanes et al., 2017, JCB). A major challenge now is to determine how the potent actin assembly-promoting
activities of APC and Dia1 are harnessed and controlled, spatially and temporally, to orchestrate leading edge
advancement. This proposal investigates the role of IQGAP in this process.
 IQGAP is a multi-domain scaffolding protein that directly binds to and bundles F-actin, binds to APC and
Dia1, and colocalizes with APC at the leading edge (Watanabe et al, 2004, Dev Cell, &amp; Brandt et al, 2007,
JCB). My preliminary in vitro observations using purified full-length IQGAP show that it directly attenuates actin
assembly induced by APC and Dia1. Additionally, using labeled IQGAP, I observed that it transiently
associates with the barbed end of the actin filament, suppressing growth. Consistent with these inhibitory
biochemical effects, I found that RNAi silencing of IQGAP in HeLa cells results in excessive F-actin
accumulation at the leading edge. Thus, my in vitro and in vivo observations are in good agreement, and
indicate that IQGAP attenuates, or `restrains' actin assembly by APC and Dia1. My working model is that
IQGAP scaffolds APC and Dia1 to spatiotemporally control actin assembly at the leading edge until the correct
signals are received (possibly Rac1, Cdc42, and/or microtubule plus end-associated proteins, all of which bind
to IQGAP).
 Using in vitro multi-wavelength single-molecule imaging, I will next define the stoichiometry and kinetics of
IQGAP's interactions with actin filaments, APC, and Dia1, and their combined regulatory effects on actin
assembly in vitro. In parallel, I will use genetic perturbations and live-cell imaging to determine the precise role
of IQGAP, and its interactions with actin, APC, and Dia1, in tuning actin dynamics at the leading edge to drive
cell migration. I will quantify the cellular effects caused by silencing each protein - on the localization dynamics
of the other components, on the assembly and turnover kinetics of leading edge actin networks, and on
directed cell migration. This work will clarify the mechanisms controlling actin network assembly in cell

As advances in clinical and medical sciences lengthen lifespan in developed countries, it
is becoming increasingly clear that aging is one of the most important risk factors for
disease. The prevalence of diseases including cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer
and dementia increases dramatically in the later years of life. Interventions that prevent
or postpone the effects of aging have the potential to transform modern medicine.
Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying aging is an important
goal.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant RNAs produced by circularization of
specific exons. Two of these RNAs, CDR1as and Sry, can act as miRNA sponges, but
no function is known for the thousands of other circRNAs found in species across the
animal kingdom. CircRNAs expression levels are not correlated with the expression of
their linear isoforms, indicating a potentially widespread layer of previously unknown
gene regulation. Recent work from others and us showed that circRNAs are enriched in
neural tissue and accumulate with age in the brain. Moreover, unpublished work from
our lab demonstrate that a subset of circRNAs produces protein and that their translation
is regulated by starvation and FOXO, pathways strongly related to aging
This proposal aims to unravel the interplay between aging, circRNAs translation and
function. For doing so, we will utilize state of the art methodologies to: Determine the
cellular substrate, temporal requirements and aging pathways involved in the life span
extension provoked by downregulation of circSif, circCG31619 and circCG11319.
Molecularly characterize the aging related roles of circSif, circGC31619 and
circCG11319. Determine the connection between translation of circRNAs and the aging
phenotypes. Determine of the connection between circRNA accumulation and function
and aging globally.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KADENER, SEBASTIAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R33DA045851</grantId><grantName>Hub and Spoke Model to Improve Pharmacotherapy Use for Opioid Addiction and Promote Recovery</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2229220.0</amount><startDate>2017-09-15</startDate><endDate>2023-08-31</endDate><keyword>Adult, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Age, ages, Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Client, Counseling, Data Sources, Pharmacotherapy, Drug Therapy, drug treatment, Elements, Employment, Experimental Designs, Federal Government, National Government, Goals, Grant, Health, Health Personnel, Health Care Providers, Healthcare Providers, Healthcare worker, health care personnel, health care worker, health provider, health workforce, healthcare personnel, medical personnel, treatment provider, Health Services Research, Health Services Evaluation, Medical Care Research, services research, Information Systems, Data Systems, IT Systems, Information Technology Systems, Insurance, Medicaid, Methods, Overdose, Ramp, Substance Use Disorder, Testing, Thinking, thoughts, United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Washington, Gender, Criminal Justice, Outcome Measure, Process Measure, Caring, improved, incarcerated, incarceration, Imprisonment, Phase, Link, Ensure, Evaluation, Recovery, Rural, Record Linkage Study, Data Linkages, Data Bases, data base, Databases, Opiates, Opioid, drug use, Drug usage, Funding, Knowledge, programs, System, Opiate Dependence, opioid addiction, opioid dependence, opioid dependent, Opiate Addiction, Services, success, Structure, Statistical Methods, Modeling, behavioral health, response, Provider, Effectiveness, Address, Evidence based practice, Data, NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Drug Abuse, Subgroup, enroll, Enrollment, comparator group, comparison group, designing, design, Outcome, Population, addictive disorder, addiction, effectiveness measure, evidence base, primary care setting, effective treatment, effective therapy, flexible, flexibility, opiate use disorder, opioid use disorder, medication-assisted treatment, sharing hub, data hub, opiate crisis, opioid crisis, opioid epidemic, primary care provider, care providers, treatment services, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, prescription monitoring program, effectiveness implementation hybrid, effectiveness implementation study,</keyword><description>The federal government, through SAMHSA’s Opioid State Targeted Response (Opioid-STR) grants, has
provided funding to each state to ramp up the range of responses in hopes of reversing the ongoing opioid
crisis. Pharmacotherapy to address opioid use disorders (OUDs) is an evidence-based practice although it is
clearly underutilized, especially by primary care providers. Washington State is implementing a “Hub &amp; Spoke”
(H&amp;S) integrated care model to expand access to pharmacotherapy services (also known as medicationassisted
treatment or MAT) and reduce unmet need for people with OUDs regardless of how or where clients
enter the treatment system. This proposed R21/R33 study will take a hybrid effectiveness-implementation
approach, with both implementation evaluation and effectiveness as primary goals. It is essential to understand
how the H&amp;S model is implemented to understand if, how, and why it is an effective approach to treat OUDs.
The specific aims for the proposed study are as follows. R21 PHASE – Early Implementation and
Feasibility: (1) Confirm the feasibility of collecting client and program data from hubs, spokes and comparison
groups; collect baseline data; and confirm data linkages with other key databases; (2) Finalize elements
needed for R33 effectiveness study, including comparison groups, dependent variables, and key analytic
subgroups; (3) Assess the early implementation of the H&amp;S model. R33 PHASE – Effectiveness: (1) Test
whether the H&amp;S model is effective for addressing OUDs; (2) Determine whether people with OUDs treated in
the H&amp;S model have better outcomes if they receive pharmacotherapy + counseling versus only
pharmacotherapy. (3) Test whether the H&amp;S model is differentially effective for subgroups (e.g., age, gender,
OUD type, mental disorder, rural); (4) Examine, using mixed methods, implementation of the H&amp;S model and
how specific aspects across and within each hub-spoke network relate to the overall effectiveness.
This study will focus primarily on adults (18+) with OUDs in Washington who are enrolled in Medicaid,
about 90% of people with OUDs in treatment in Washington. Effectiveness measure include a range of
structure, outcome and process measures at client- and system-levels, including drug use, overdose, access
to pharmacotherapy, and arrests, incarceration and employment. Washington is a leader in addiction treatment
services and detailed, linkable data systems. Statistical methods will be used to ensure a rigorous quasiexperimental
design. The findings from this study will enable us to understand the essential elements of the
H&amp;S model for the most effective treatment for OUDs, and how to bring more primary care providers to the
addiction pharmacotherapy practice. It will serve as a model for other states and systems, offering a flexible
approach that addresses many existing barriers to the use of pharmacotherapy for people with OUDs, ensuring
that there is no wrong door to enter treatment and that people with OUDs receive the treatment with the best
success for promoting recovery.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1763926</grantId><grantName>RI:Medium:Collaborative Research:Developing a uniform meaning representation for natural language processing</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>399237.0</amount><startDate>2018-08-01</startDate><endDate>2021-07-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Xue, Nianwen</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1802440</grantId><grantName>Higher Rank Selmer Groups</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>149999.0</amount><startDate>2018-08-01</startDate><endDate>2021-07-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Bellaiche, Joel</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM121384</grantId><grantName>Joint Bayesian analysis of single-molecule colocalization images and kinetics</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1293600.0</amount><startDate>2018-08-01</startDate><endDate>2022-04-30</endDate><keyword>Algorithms, Biochemistry, Biological Chemistry, Biology, Cell Extracts, Cell physiology, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cells, Cell Body, Classification, Systematics, Communicable Diseases, Infectious Disease Pathway, Infectious Diseases, Infectious Disorder, Data Analyses, Data Analysis, data interpretation, Discrimination, Cognitive Discrimination, Disease, Disorder, DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Fluorescence Agents, Fluorescent Agents, fluorescent dye/probe, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Action Regulation, Gene Regulation, Gene Regulation Process, Goals, Health, Human, Modern Man, instrumentation, Joints, Kinetics, Laboratories, Manuals, Markov Chains, Markov Process, Metabolic Diseases, Metabolic Disorder, Thesaurismosis, metabolism disorder, Methods, Fluorescence Microscopy, Fluorescence Light Microscopy, Nucleic Acids, Organism, living system, Probability, Proteins, Public Health, Research, Ribosomes, RNA, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA Splicing, Splicing, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Computer software, Software, Spectrum Analysis, Spectroscopy, Spectrum Analyses, statistics, Testing, Time, Work, Photons, Data Set, Dataset, Spliceosomes, analytical method, base, macromolecule, Label, Microscope, improved, Image Analysis, Image Analyses, image evaluation, image interpretation, Biochemical, Series, Chemicals, Individual, Bayesian Analysis, Bayesian computation, Bayesian inference, Bayesian network analysis, Bayesian spatial analysis, Bayesian statistical analysis, Bayesian statistical inference, Bayesian statistics, Bayesian Method, Bayesian Methodology, Bayesian Statistical Method, Bayesian approaches, Bayesian classification method, Bayesian classification procedure, Bayesian posterior distribution, Biological Process, Biological Function, Spottings, Adopted, light microscopy, Complex, Reaction, Techniques, System, experience, Performance, stoichiometry, Cryo-electron Microscopy, Electron Cryomicroscopy, cryo-EM, cryoEM, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Human Biology, novel, Modeling, theories, single molecule, Genomics, Photobleaching, Bio-Informatics, Bioinformatics, Molecular Interaction, Binding, protein structures, proteins structure, protein structure, Data, Motor, Resolution, Molecular, Process, protein function, Development, developmental, Image, imaging, Pathway interactions, pathway, markov model, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, Outcome, Molecular Machines, two-dimensional, 2-dimensional, open source, reconstitution, reconstitute, microscopic imaging, microscope imaging, microscopy imaging, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, multidimensional data, high dimensional data, multidimensional datasets, large datasets, large data sets,</keyword><description>Project Summary
 A central concern of the present post-genomic era of biology is understanding at the molecular level the
chemical and physical mechanisms by which the protein and RNA machines that perform all cellular functions
operate. Multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence co-localization techniques (“CoSMoS”; co-localization
single-molecule spectroscopy) methods have been widely adopted and used to elucidate the functional
mechanisms of a broad range of macromolecular machines ranging from individual motor enzymes to the
ribosome and spliceosome. However, efficient and accurate CoSMoS data analysis, particularly of large,
multi-dimensional datasets, remains challenging. CoSMoS datasets are inherently difficult to analyze because
observations of thermally-driven single-molecule processes at the limited excitation intensities needed to avoid
photobleaching are intrinsically noisy and stochastic and thus would benefit from objective methods based on
optimized statistical theory to derive accurate conclusions.
 This application proposes a new approach to CoSMoS data analysis based on Bayesian image
classification, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo, and other statistics-based methods. The overall project
goal is to produce analytical methods that are more accurate than existing approaches, readily scalable to
large datasets, and are more reliable, even in the hands of less experienced users. In particular, we will
develop algorithms and implement software that will 1) make full use of the information contained in the two-
dimensional CoSMoS images, 2) use objective, statistically rigorous approaches to calculate the probability of
a given molecular species being present in each image, 3) integrate kinetic analysis with image classification to
allow the most accurate conclusions about molecular mechanisms based on available data, and 4) eliminate
the manual analysis and subjective parameter tweaking that introduce bias in existing analytical methods. The
developed models and algorithms will be refined and validated through thorough testing against a broad range
of simulated and known-outcome empirical data sets. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) enhance the
Time-Independent Bayesian Spot Discrimination algorithm and characterize its performance, 2) develop,
implement and characterize a time-dependent Joint Bayesian Discrimination/Hidden Markov Modeling
(BD/HMM) algorithm to derive molecular mechanisms from CoSMoS data, and 3) develop and distribute a
usable, documented, open-source software package for Bayesian CoSMoS image analysis.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GELLES, JEFF </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31AI133945</grantId><grantName>Ionotropic Receptor Function in Anopheles gambiae</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>61340.0</amount><startDate>2018-08-01</startDate><endDate>2020-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Air, Alleles, Allelomorphs, Animals, Anopheles Genus, Anopheles, Antibodies, Antibody Specificity, Arthropod Vectors, Behavior, Bite, Blood, Blood Reticuloendothelial System, Body Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, Carbonic Anhydride, CO2, chikungunya, Cues, Death, Cessation of life, breakbone fever, Dengue Fever, Dengue, Dessication, Desiccation, Disorder, Disease, Disease Vectors, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Drosophila melanogaster, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Family, Goals, Health, Modern Man, Human, Humidity, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue, Immunohistochemistry, Infection, Insect Vectors, Insects Invertebrates, Insects, Insecta, Larva, Plasmodium Infections, Paludism, Malaria, Mosquitoes, Culicidae, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, Odors, Oviposition, Play, Public Health, Reproduction, social role, Role, Sensation, Esthesia, Temperature, thermoreception, temperature sensation, Temperature Sense, Testing, Work, Reading Frame Shift Mutation, Frame Shift Mutation, Frameshift Mutation, Mediating, Humidifier, Site, insight, Stimulus, Anopheles gambiae, Stream, Sensory, Pattern, Location, interest, mutant, receptor, Receptor Protein, Base Pairing, member, behavior test, behavioral test, response, receptor function, Address, Detection, Molecular, Behavioral, Vector-transmitted infectious disease, vectorborne infectious disease, vectorborne illness, vectorborne disease, vector-borne illness, Vector-transmitted disease, Vector-borne infectious disease, Vector-borne disease, fly, Flies, vector mosquito, vector, fight against, feeding, Behavioral Assay, loss of function mutation, human disease, behavioral response, behavior response, behavioral study, behavior study, genome editing, genomic editing, Zika Virus, zikav, ZIKV, ZIKA, CRISPR/Cas technology, Cas nuclease technology, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas method, CRISPR-based tool, CRISPR-based technology, CRISPR-based technique, CRISPR-based method, CRISPR-CAS-9, CRISPR technology, CRISPR technique, CRISPR methodology, CRISPR method, experimental study, experimental research, experiment,</keyword><description>Project Summary/ Abstract
 Mosquitoes are important vectors for widespread human diseases from malaria to dengue, zika virus and
chikungunya, and temperature and moisture detection are critical for supporting mosquito survival,
reproduction and host-seeking. Accurately sensing environmental temperature is important for maintaining
optimal body temperature, while sensing humidity is important for avoiding desiccation. Temperature and
humidity are also important cues for host-seeking and blood-feeding, and moisture is important for oviposition
as mosquito larvae are aquatic. But despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermo-
and hygro-sensing in mosquitoes remain largely unknown.
 Recent work in the Garrity lab has identified key members of a receptor family that modulate cold sensing
and moisture sensing in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These receptors are conserved in vector
mosquitoes and highly expressed in their antennae, consistent with the notion that they serve similar sensory
roles. Anopheles gambiae is the major vector for malaria and was responsible for over two hundred million
infections in 2015. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature and humidity sensing in
Anopheles gambiae could provide key insights for strategies to control this important disease vector and has
potential implications for similar mechanisms in other vector mosquitoes.
 In my preliminary studies, I have used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in Anopheles gambiae to create
mutants containing putative loss-of-function mutations in these receptors. I propose to use a combination of
electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry and behavioral studies to establish the role(s) of these receptors in
thermo- and hygro-sensing in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. My work will address the sensory function of
these receptors in mosquitoes and probe their potential roles in host-seeking behavior.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GREPPI, CHLOE </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1800681</grantId><grantName>Bijective Approach to Discrete Geometries</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>149988.0</amount><startDate>2018-07-01</startDate><endDate>2021-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Bernardi, Olivier</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1810077</grantId><grantName>The role of boundaries in 2D active nematics</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>482672.0</amount><startDate>2018-07-01</startDate><endDate>2021-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Fraden, Seth</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DC016834</grantId><grantName>Cochlear implants and listening effort: the interaction of cognitive and sensory constraints</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2608749.0</amount><startDate>2018-07-01</startDate><endDate>2023-06-30</endDate><keyword>Acoustics, Acoustic, Adult, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Affect, Age, ages, Elderly, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Cochlear Implants, Cochlear Prosthesis, Communication, Counseling, Face, faces, facial, Family, Grant, Hearing Aids, assistive hearing device, assistive listening device, hearing amplification, hearing assistance, hearing assistive device, hearing device, Human, Modern Man, indexing, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Linguistics, Linguistic, Short-Term Memory, Immediate Memory, Shortterm Memory, working memory, Modernization, Persons, Noise, Patients, Perception, Physiologic Psychology, Physiological Psychology, Psychophysiological, physiopsychology, psycho-physiological, Psychophysiology, QOL, Quality of life, Research, Research Resources, Resources, social role, Role, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Speech, Speech Intelligibilities, Speech Intelligibility, Speech Perception, Testing, Time, United States, Measures, Outcomes Research, Resource Allocation, Comprehension, improved, Chronic, Clinical, Medical, Series, Evaluation, Failure, insight, Individual, adult youth, young adulthood, young adult, Lepus, Hares, Cognitive Disturbance, Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive decline, Cognitive function abnormal, Disturbance in cognition, cognitive dysfunction, cognitive loss, Impaired cognition, Knowledge, Auditory, Complex, Sensory, restoration, processing speed, Performance, success, syntactic, syntax, knowledge base, Structure, novel, Participant, Reporting, Modeling, Effectiveness, Hearing Loss, Hypoacuses, Hypoacusis, dysfunctional hearing, hearing defect, hearing deficit, hearing difficulty, hearing disability, hearing dysfunction, hearing impairment, Address, Age-Years, Data, Detection, Cognitive, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, age related, age dependent, older patient, elderly patient, Population, aged, Implant, speech processing, rehabilitation strategy, rehab strategy, standard measure, natural language, operation, cognitive load, cognitive burden, sensory input, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, preservation, normal hearing, good hearing, healthy hearing,</keyword><description>Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, with hearing loss the third most prevalent
chronic medical condition. Untreated, hearing loss can interfere with effective communication, quality of life,
and potentially accelerate cognitive decline. Cochlear implants (CI) have seen increasing use for older adults,
with one implant center reporting a nearly 500% increase over a recent ten-year period in the number of
individuals aged 60 or older receiving CIs. The auditory input provided by a CI is sharply degraded with respect
to that of a person with normal hearing or even with mild to moderate hearing loss, but patients can adapt well
to this novel input- at least when measured by standard clinical tests of word identification (e.g., CNC words) or
perception of simple sentences (e.g., AzBio sentences). However, clinicians are often puzzled by patients,
especially older adults, who seem to do well on standard tests but report major difficulties in everyday speech
interactions.
This grant builds upon the hypothesis that the combined constraints of the sharply degraded signal provided by
a CI and finite cognitive resources may lead to a “tipping point” when listeners are confronted with complex
sentences and discourse arriving at normally rapid speech rates. Beyond this tipping point communication may
become too difficult, even for CI recipients whose standard speech intelligibility scores are above average. This
grant brings together a unique combination of three converging approaches: (1) We examine the ability of
younger adult and older adult CI users to comprehend and remember the content of linguistically complex
sentences and multi-sentence discourse, and probe potential effects on the cognitive mechanisms listeners
use to process speech input, an underlying issue as yet unexplored in CI research; (2) For each experiment we
will conduct a parallel study with normal-hearing younger and older adults using channel vocoded and
unprocessed speech, with the former allowing a systematic determination of the interaction between signal
degradation and the complexity of the speech materials on their recall, and the latter to illustrate a baseline of
optimal performance on the same tasks for age-matched adults; (3) We will use modern pupillometry
measures as an objective index of cognitive effort time-locked to the content of the speech input. The
knowledge gained will test current models of resource allocation and listening effort as mechanisms underlying
effects of cognitive load when younger and older adult CI users face the natural complexity of everyday
sentences and discourse. Results of the studies will be valuable for counseling CI recipients and their families
and will help develop more comprehensive evaluation batteries and rehabilitative strategies for the older adult
CI recipient.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WINGFIELD, ARTHUR </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31NS108506</grantId><grantName>From Molecules to Behavior: The Role of Homeostatic Synaptic Scaling in Associative Learning and Memory</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>92482.8</amount><startDate>2018-08-01</startDate><endDate>2021-12-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Behavior, Cell physiology, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cells, Cell Body, classical conditioning, Associative Learning, Pavlovian conditioning, associative conditioning, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Extinction (Psychology), Extinction, behavioral extinction, Feedback, Goals, Learning, Memory, Methods, Study models, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Physiology, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Research, Research Proposals, Role, social role, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Stains, Staining method, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders, PTSD, Post-Traumatic Neuroses, Posttraumatic Neuroses, Posttraumatic Stress Disorders, post-trauma stress disorder, posttrauma stress disorder, traumatic neurosis, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Syndrome, Testing, Time, Virus, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, Work, Mediating, Acute, Chronic, Physiologic, Physiological, Longterm Potentiation, Long-Term Potentiation, Training, insight, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, Nature, Infusion, Infusion procedures, experience, sensory cortex, memory acquisition, memory processing, memory process, Modeling, response, CNS Nervous System, Central Nervous System, Neuraxis, Long-Term Synaptic Depression, longterm depression, longterm synaptic depression, Long-Term Depression, fear conditioning, conditioned fear, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Early Infantile Autism, Infantile Autism, Kanner's Syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, autism spectrum disorder, in vivo, Neurosciences Research, Slice, Process, Modification, Behavioral, Output, Behavioral Paradigm, neuronal excitability, Outcome, synaptic depression, Synaptic plasticity, postsynaptic, Conditioned Taste Aversion, Taste aversion, experiment, experimental research, experimental study, preservation, neural network, Computerized Models, computational modeling, computational models, computer based models, computerized modeling, Computer Models,</keyword><description>Project Summary
A central goal of neuroscience research is to advance our understanding of the cellular physiology
underlying learning and memory processes. The most extensively studied model for how
associative learning is achieved at the cellular level is the Hebbian modification of synapses.
However, computational modeling studies have demonstrated that these forms of plasticity follow
positive feedback rules, making them inherently destabilizing in nature. Without additional
features, Hebbian plasticity could give way to “unconstrained” changes in synaptic strengths,
resulting in the disruption of associative learning. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is hypothesized
to be the basis for neural-network stability during learning-driven changes of synaptic strength.
Synaptic scaling, the most extensively studied form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, functions
as a negative-feedback mechanism, bidirectionally regulating synaptic strengths, in a cell-
autonomous manner, to maintain an activity set point. Synaptic scaling is thus hypothesized to
constrain the positive feedback nature of Hebbian mechanisms while simultaneously preserving
circuit features permissive to learning. Despite its potential to impact our current understanding
of associative learning processes, this hypothesis remains untested and the consequences of
disrupted synaptic scaling on learning remain unknown. This proposal aims to determine
the role of homeostatic synaptic scaling in associative learning and memory using a
conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm in rats. First, I will confirm that I can induce

acute slice electrophysiology. Second, I aim to characterize the effects of synaptic scaling loss on
engram excitability. I will train rats on a CTA behavior paradigm and then perform
immunofluorescent staining to characterize the time course of learning-driven changes in CTA
engram neuron excitability. Then, I will use a combination of ex-vivo acute slice electrophysiology
and virus mediated targeting of CTA engram neurons to characterize the impact of blocked
homeostatic plasticity on the underlying cellular physiology of associative learning. Lastly, I will
determine the role of homeostatic plasticity in memory acquisition &amp; extinction using behavioral

Naloxone is a
population-level prevention intervention associated with substantial reductions in overdose mortality.
Furthermore, emerging data suggest that co-prescription of naloxone to people at risk of overdose from chronic
opioid therapies may reduce negative health outcomes earlier in the risk horizon by avoiding nonfatal overdose.
Expanding access to naloxone in the community through the pharmacy can be a critical mechanism for extending
this lifesaving medication’s reach. Pharmacies exist in nearly every community and are staffed by knowledgeable
health professionals trained in counseling patients about medication safety; many states also permit pharmacies
to sell syringes over the counter for drug injection. Pharmacies’ pivotal role in dispensing medications and selling
syringes places them at the crossroads of opioid access and risk mitigation methods like naloxone provision.
Testing ways to optimize pharmacy based naloxone (PBN) provision will be key as the country expands the
implementation of naloxone through the medical system. We propose a large, practical study of a pharmacy-
focused intervention to increase PBN dispensing and improve opioid safety. The intervention is comprised of
two successful demonstration research projects (RESPOND, PI: Hartung; MOON Study, PI: Green, both R18),
which include online and one-on-one educational outreach (i.e. academic detailing) demonstrated to provide
knowledge and training for pharmacists to identify and effectively engage with patients who may be at high-risk
for an opioid overdose. The overarching goal of this study is to reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths in
the United States through greater access and use of naloxone, and safer opioid use. Uniquely, the study will
draw from partnerships with two large retail pharmacy chains, CVS Pharmacy and Fred Meyer (a division of
Kroger Corporation), who will provide a “real-world” sample to support replicability and external validity. Specific
aims are to: Aim 1: Integrate the MOON and RESPOND toolkit materials into one cohesive educational program
(MOON+), and streamline the materials to enhance the focus on naloxone policy, communication, and
administration; Aim 2: Using a stepped wedge, clustered randomized trial design, evaluate the effectiveness of
MOON+ in 160 community pharmacies in increasing: a) PBN distribution rates, naloxone-related patient
engagement, and pharmacists’ attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward
naloxone; and b) pharmacy syringe sales, and pharmacists’ attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control
and self-efficacy toward dispensing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (secondary outcomes). Aim 3:
Applying a mixed methods approach, identify facilitators and barriers (e.g. state and store policies, regional
characteristics) to implementation and effectiveness. Study findings will create a generalizable, evidence-based
training and toolkit for pharmacists caring for patients who use prescribed or illicit opioids, in the over 40 states
adopting or expanding pharmacy naloxone.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GREEN, TRACI C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1811402</grantId><grantName>EAGER:  Collaborative Research: Mining Scientific Literature with the LAPPS Grid</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>99344.0</amount><startDate>2018-06-01</startDate><endDate>2019-05-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Pustejovsky, James</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>1811111</grantId><grantName>Applications of Gauge Theory and Floer Homology to Low-Dimensional Topology</grantName><funderCode>49</funderCode><funderAgency>National Science Foundation</funderAgency><amount>219017.0</amount><startDate>2018-09-01</startDate><endDate>2021-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId>Ruberman, Daniel</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35GM127029</grantId><grantName>DNA damage response and repair of a broken chromosome</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4650266.0</amount><startDate>2018-06-01</startDate><endDate>2023-05-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Bacteria, Biological Chemistry, Biochemistry, borrelial, Borrelia, B burgdorferi, B. burgdorferi, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borreliella burgdorferi, Lyme Disease Spirochete, lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, Cell Body, Cells, Chromosomes, DNA Damage, DNA Injury, DNA Repair, DNA Damage Repair, Unscheduled DNA Synthesis, Single-Stranded DNA, Saccharomycetales, Budding Yeast, Endomycetales, Gene Conversion, Genes, Goals, Grant, Human, Modern Man, Immunologic Surveillance, Immune Surveillance, Immunologic Surveillances, Immunological Surveillance, Immunological Surveillances, Immunosurveillance, Lyme Disease, Lyme Borreliosis, Biological Models, Biologic Models, Model System, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Pseudogenes, Genetic Recombination, DNA Recombination, Recombination, Research, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Mediating, Site, Area, repair, repaired, insight, Funding, Chromosome Break, Chromosomal Breaks, Malignant Cell, cancer cell, Investigation, Complex, Event, homologous recombination, response, Genomic Instability, Genome Instability, DNA damage checkpoint, DNA damage check point, DNA damage check point response, DNA damage checkpoint response, Cell Cycle Arrest, Double Strand Break Repair, Mammalian Cell, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, in vivo, Cell Cycle Progression, Monitor, Molecular, Process, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR, CRISPR/Cas system,</keyword><description>The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to describe the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which cells sense the presence of DNA damage and how they repair
chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs). Primarily using budding yeast as a model system, it
is possible to induce site-specific DSBs with a high degree of synchrony that is not generally
possible in mammalian cells, allowing “in vivo biochemistry” approaches to monitor intermediate
steps in DSB repair and DNA damage signaling. We also wish to apply our understanding of DNA
repair and recombination mechanisms to elucidate how the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia
burgdorferi, is able to “change its coat” by repeated gene conversion events.
The goals for the next five years of this project focus on understanding how homologous donor
sequences are found and used to repair a DSB and how mismatches are tolerated and repaired
during different steps of recombination. A second objective is to understand the basis of the 1000-
fold increase in mutations associated with DSB repair and how microhomologies are used in
repair-dependent template switching, creating complex chromosome rearrangements analogous
to events recently found in human cancers. We employ similar approaches to elucidating how
CRISPR/as9-mediated gene editing is accomplished using single-stranded DNA templates. A
third area of concern is to understand how the DNA damage checkpoint is regulated. We wish to
determine how the DNA damage response affects DSB repair and how the DNA damage
checkpoint is maintained and turned off. These studies will provide new insights and guidance in
defining the DSB repair and checkpoint signaling in human cells.
Finally, we will continue our investigation of the mechanisms by which Borrelia initiates and
mediates gene conversion events between one expressed gene and a set of adjacent
pseudogenes.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HABER, JAMES E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AI140030</grantId><grantName>Directed Evolution of Zika EDE Glycoantigens</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>450901.43</amount><startDate>2018-05-15</startDate><endDate>2021-04-30</endDate><keyword>Congenital Abnormality, Congenital Malformation, Congenital Deformity, Congenital Defects, Congenital Anatomical Abnormality, Congenital Anatomic Abnormality, Birth Defects, Adult, adulthood, Adult Human, 21+ years old, Americas, Antibodies, Monoclonal Antibodies, mAbs, Clinical Treatment Moab, Antibody Specificity, Epitopes, Binding Determinants, Antigenic Determinants, Antigens, immunogen, ATGN, Antiviral Agents, anti-virals, anti-viral drugs, anti-viral agents, Antivirals, Antiviral Drugs, Bacteriophages, bacterial virus, Phages, Antibody Binding Sites, antibody combining site, Paratopes, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Blood Circulation, Circulation, Bloodstream, Carbohydrates, Cell Body, Cells, Dangerousness, breakbone fever, Dengue Fever, Dengue, Breakbone Fever Virus, Dengue Virus, Disorder, Disease, Elements, Exhibits, Eyeball, Eye, Group B Arbovirus, Flavivirus, Future, env Protein, env Polyproteins, env Antigens, Envelope Protein, env Gene Products, geographic site, Geographical Location, Geographic Region, Geographic Area, Geographic Locations, Glycopeptides, Glycoproteins, Goals, ontogeny, Tissue Growth, Generalized Growth, Growth, acute postinfectious polyneuropathy, acute post-infectious polyneuropathy, acute idiopathic polyneuritis, Landry-Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Landry's paralysis, Guillaine-Barre Syndrome, Acute Inflammatory Polyradiculoneuropathy, Acute Inflammatory Polyneuropathy, Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy, Acute Infective Polyneuritis, Acute Autoimmune Neuropathy, AIDP, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Modern Man, Human, newborn children, newborn child, Newborns, 0-4 weeks old, Newborn Infant, Infection, Libraries, microencephaly, micrencephaly, Microcephaly, conformational state, conformation, Molecular Stereochemistry, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Conformation, Patients, Peptide Fragments, Peptides, Glycans, Polysaccharides, Proteins, Public Health, antibody receptor, Fc Receptor, study design, Study Type, Research Design, mRNA, Messenger RNA, Safety, Serotyping, Technology, Vaccines, virus protein, Viral Gene Proteins, Viral Gene Products, Viral Proteins, Virus Particle, Virion, General Viruses, Virus, Xrays, X-Rays Radiation, X-Rays, X-Radiation, Roentgen Rays, Yeasts, Mediating, Muscular Weakness, Muscle Weakness, base, Area, Serological, Serologic, Neurologic, Neurological, uptake, Directed Molecular Evolution, directed evolution, Antibody-Dependent Enhancement, scaffold, scaffolding, Complex, Side, Autoimmune Process, Autoimmune, Reaction, Techniques, neutralizing antibody, Viral, Paralysed, paralytic, paralysis, Plegia, Palsy, dimer, mutant, particle, vaccine development, vaccine formulation, development of a vaccine, develop a vaccine, hazard, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell, PBMC, Structure, prenatal, unborn, response, protein aminoacid sequence, peptide sequence, peptide aminoacid sequence, Molecular Interaction, Binding, hearing impairment, hearing dysfunction, hearing disability, hearing difficulty, hearing deficit, hearing defect, dysfunctional hearing, Hypoacusis, Hypoacuses, Hearing Loss, Defect, Data, Development, developmental, immunogenicity, design, designing, human monoclonal antibodies, human monoclonals, human mAbs, humAbs, Hu-mABs, Impairment, novel vaccines, next generation vaccines, new vaccines, mouse model, murine model, high risk, combat, Antibody Response, Zika Virus, zikav, ZIKV, ZIKA, Dengue Infection, dengue viral infection, Dengue virus infection, DENV infection, Dengue Vaccine, Dengue virus vaccine, DENV vaccine, Zika virus vaccine, Zika vaccine, ZIKV infection, zika viral infection, zika infection, Zika virus infection, infection risk, mosquito-borne, mosquitoborne,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
An estimated 2.3 billion people live at risk of infection by the Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus
that causes microcephaly in newborns, as well as eye- and neurological defects, and Guillain-Barre
syndrome in adults. Zika co-circulates in the same geographical region with the four serotypes of Dengue
virus, which is of concern for both Dengue and Zika vaccine development. Antibodies that develop in
response to Dengue can enhance Zika infection, and vice versa (Antibody-Dependent Enhancement,
ADE). A recently discovered class of antibodies has been found to exhibit less ADE; these antibodies
broadly and potently neutralize Zika and all four Dengue serotypes, and do so by binding to a quaternary
epitope at the interface between adjacent E glycoprotein subunits on the viral envelope. This envelope
dimer epitope (EDE) is a promising target for vaccine development.
The goal of this exploratory R21 project is to discover glycopeptides that are good structural mimics of
the EDE on ZIKV. Such molecules, when used as vaccine immunogens, should stimulate a broadly
neutralizing antibody response that is protective against ZIKV, while avoiding ADE effects. The Krauss
lab will use its directed evolution technology to scaffold the carbohydrate and peptide components of the
EDE into arrangements that enable strong recognition by EDE antibodies, producing EDE mimics. Two
further types of studies will then determine which among these glycopeptide “hits” are best for future
immunogenicity studies. The Sarathy and Barrett labs with determine whether selected glycopeptides
compete with ZIKV for binding to the EDE antibodies, whereas the Wilson lab will determine structures
of glycopeptide-antibody complexes to determine whether glycopeptides bind to the antibodies through
ZIKV-like contacts.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AI140018</grantId><grantName>Developing Homology-Independent Targeted Insertion (HITI) toolkits for molecular genetic manipulation of Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>460100.0</amount><startDate>2018-05-02</startDate><endDate>2021-04-30</endDate><keyword>Alleles, Allelomorphs, Anopheles Genus, Anopheles, Epitopes, Binding Determinants, Antigenic Determinants, Biology, Cell Body, Cells, Death, Cessation of life, Disease Vectors, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Drosophila melanogaster, Genes, Genome, Goals, Health, Modern Man, Human, Plasmodium Infections, Paludism, Malaria, Mammalia, Mammals, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, Genetic Models, Mosquitoes, Culicidae, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, living system, Organism, Reagent, Research, Researchers, Investigators, Research Personnel, backbone, Spine, Spinal Column, Vertebral column, Testing, Transcription factor genes, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, General Transcription Factors, General Transcription Factor Gene, Basal transcription factor genes, Basal Transcription Factor, transcription factor, Work, Generations, gRNA, Guide RNA, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, Imagery, Visualization, base, genetic manipulation, Label, improved, Site, repaired, repair, Ensure, Gene Targeting, disease transmission, infectious disease transmission, communicable disease transmission, Collaborations, Anopheles gambiae, Reporter, tool, Complex, Location, calcium indicator, experience, mutant, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, technology development, tech development, Transgenic Organisms, transgenic, Speed, member, Basic Science, Basic Research, genetic technology, Modeling, Genomics, Double Strand Break Repair, Effectiveness, Data, Collection, Nonhomologous DNA End Joining, Nonhomologous End Joining, Non-homologous DNA End Joining, Non-Homologous End Joining, NHEJ, Knock-out, Knockout, Modification, Development, developmental, fly, Flies, vector control, vector, cost, insertion/deletion mutation, insertion/deletion, insertion-deletion mutation, insertion-deletion, indel, Population, genome-wide, genomewide, genome scale, optogenetics, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR, genetic approach, genome editing, genomic editing, CRISPR/Cas technology, Cas nuclease technology, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas method, CRISPR-based tool, CRISPR-based technology, CRISPR-based technique, CRISPR-based method, CRISPR-CAS-9, CRISPR technology, CRISPR technique, CRISPR methodology, CRISPR method, Knock-in, knockin, DNA cassette, transgene cassette, transcriptional cassette, transcription cassette, stop cassette, selection cassette, selectable cassette, resistance cassette, reporter cassette, promoter cassette, integration cassette, genetic cassette, gene cassette, expression cassette, enhancer cassette, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, implementation strategy, malaria mosquito,</keyword><description>Project Summary / Abstract
CRISPR-mediated genome editing is accelerating basic research and its application to
improve human health. In traditional genetic model organisms, like the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster, CRISPR has accelerated and simplified genetic manipulations.
In organisms where genome modifications have been more challenging, like the malaria
mosquito Anopheles gambiae, CRISPR-based genome editing presents new
opportunities to study their biology and to disrupt disease transmission. Here we
propose to simplify and expedite CRISPR-based genome editing for fly and mosquito
researchers.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
1) We will develop and optimize a universal CRISPR toolkit for genome
editing in Drosophila. In aims 1.a and 1.b, we will optimize a set of simple-to-use
targeting vectors that will speed and simplify the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 gene
editing in Drosophila. In aim 1.c., we will modify these optimized vectors to generate a
set of reagents that will allow investigators to readily create fluorescently labeled
targeted knockouts and reporter knock-ins (including Gal4, GFP and epitope-tags) by
simply combining gene-specific gRNAs with these universal reagents.
Aim #2: Develop and optimize a uHITI toolkit for genome editing in
Anopheles. In aim 2.a., we will optimize our targeting approach for use in A. gambiae.
In aim 2.b., we will modify these optimized A. gambiae vectors to generate a set of
reagents to allow investigators to create targeted knock-outs and reporter knock-ins
(including the QF transcription factor, GFP, epitope-tags and a genetically encoded
calcium indicator) by combining gene-specific gRNAs with these universal reagents.
These tools will simplify and expedite the generation of targeted knock-outs and knock-
ins by investigators studying Drosophila and Anopheles. In Drosophila, these tools will
also increase the feasibility of creating genome-wide knock-out and knock-in collections.
In Anopheles, these tools can expedite the introduction of complex gene cassettes into
different genomic locations in order to disrupt vector populations.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21GM128442</grantId><grantName>Stereoselective Assembly of Challenging Glycosidic Linkages with Earth-Abundant Metal Catalysts</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>416501.09</amount><startDate>2018-05-01</startDate><endDate>2022-04-30</endDate><keyword>Amination, Biological Response Modifier Therapy, Biologic Therapy, biotherapy, biotherapeutics, biological treatment, biological therapeutic, Biological Therapy, Biomedical Research, Carbohydrates, chemical synthesis, Clinical Study, Clinical Research, Complement Proteins, Complement, Disorder, Disease, Foundations, Glycosides, Metabolic Glycosylation, glycosylation, Goals, Health, Heparinic Acid, Heparin, Hydroxylamine, Ions, Metals, Methods, Nucleic Acids, Oligosaccharides, Play, Glycans, Polysaccharides, Proteins, Reagent, Research, social role, Role, Science, Technology, catalyst, base, method development, Solid, Phase, Biological, Physiological, Physiologic, Series, Planet Earth, Earth, Biological Process, Biological Function, Iron, Fe element, tool, Complex, One-Step dentin bonding system, One Step, technology development, tech development, Structure, novel, Bypass, drug discovery, Address, Process, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, design, designing, novel strategies, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, innovation, innovative, innovate, public health relevance,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 Complex carbohydrates play important roles in a variety of biological functions and disease processes;
however, their structural complexity and limited availability in homogeneous forms represent a major roadblock
that hampers study of their important functions in numerous biological processes. While synthetic approaches
that assemble nucleic acids and proteins have been well-established, the robust tools and technologies for
complex-carbohydrate synthesis are still limited. Although a range of effective glycosylation approaches have
been developed, new glycosylation methods based on novel mechanisms are still urgently needed which can
rapidly and stereoselectively assemble glycosidic linkages that prove challenging with existing technologies.
 Our long-term goal is to develop new stereoselective glycosylation technologies that address
challenging glycosidic linkages based on novel mechanisms. The objective of the proposed research is to
develop a series of iron-catalyzed one-step glycal cis-amidoglycosylation approaches to assemble a wide
variety of 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages that prove challenging with existing methods. Our underlying idea
of this exploratory research is that a structurally unique iron-nitrenoid may bypass the conventional
oxocarbenium ion-based glycosylation pathways, and that it can stereoselectively transfer both an amido group
and an iron-bound glycosyl acceptor in nearly exclusive cis-fashion to a glycal, presumably through a 2-
amidoglycosyl radical species. The proposed research will explore this idea in the context of two Specific Aims.
First, we plan to discover new iron catalysts and amination reagents and develop a range of iron-catalyzed cis-
amidoglycosylation approaches that effectively assemble a variety of cis-amido glycosidic linkages. Second,
we will further develop this new approach into robust technology for complex-carbohydrate synthesis.
 This proposed approach is innovative because it explores the new glycosylation approaches in a
context that significantly departs both from the well-known oxocarbenium ion-based glycosylation strategies
and from the established reactivity of metal-nitrenoids. The proposed research is significant because it will
provide a general solution to assemble 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages and lay the foundation for the
development of an array of under-explored, earth-abundant metal-catalyzed approaches for challenging
glycosidic-bond formation. Completion of the proposed research will provide a range of iron-catalyzed methods
that effectively afford a wide variety of 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages. These robust and easily adaptable
synthetic approaches will complement the known methods and fill an important gap of existing glycosylation
technologies. Further development of this technology will add valuable tools for the automated carbohydrate
synthesis, which will significantly advance biomedical sciences.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, HAO </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>W911NF1610094</grantId><grantName>CONTROL OF HYPERPLASTIC CHEMOMECHANICAL MATERIALS</grantName><funderCode>97</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Defense</funderAgency><amount>150000.0</amount><startDate>2016-04-01</startDate><endDate>2017-09-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>W911NF1610094</grantId><grantName>CONTROL OF HYPERPLASTIC CHEMOMECHANICAL MATERIALS</grantName><funderCode>97</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of the Army</funderAgency><amount>300000.0</amount><startDate>2016-04-01</startDate><endDate>2019-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>W911NF1510097</grantId><grantName>THE WESTERN JIHADISM DATA COLLECTION</grantName><funderCode>97</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Defense</funderAgency><amount>277474.0</amount><startDate>2015-03-15</startDate><endDate>2016-12-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>U01MH105949</grantId><grantName>Combining genetics, genomics, and anatomy to classify cell types across mammals</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3383932.0</amount><startDate>2014-09-26</startDate><endDate>2018-05-31</endDate><keyword>Accounting, Algorithms, Anatomy Qualifier, Anatomical Sciences, Anatomic structures, Anatomic Structures and Systems, Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance, Anatomic Sites, Anatomic, Anatomy, Atlases, Axon, psychological disorder, psychiatric illness, mental illness, Psychiatric Disorder, Psychiatric Disease, Mental health disorders, Mental disorders, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Cell Body, Cells, Chromatin, Systematics, Classification, Complement Proteins, Complement, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Elements, Evolution, frontal cortex, frontal lobe, Gene Expression, Genes, Health, Modern Man, Human, innervation, nerve supply, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Interneurons, Logic, Mammalia, Mammals, Maps, Methods, Laboratory mice, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Mus, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, Neuroanatomies, Neuranatomy, Neuranatomies, Neuroanatomy, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, living system, Organism, Phenotype, Physiology, Problem Solving, Proteins, Rats Mammals, Rat, Common Rat Strains, Rattus, genetic regulatory element, Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions, Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, Work, Prosencephalon, Forebrain, Fore-Brain, Enhancers, Data Set, Dataset, base, density, species difference, improved, Site, Area, Physiologic, Physiological, Synaptic Terminals, Synaptic Boutons, Presynaptic Nerve Endings, Axon Terminals, Presynaptic Terminals, Collaborations, Genetic, Syntenic Homology, Synteny, Morphology, Reporter, Knowledge, Scientist, cell type, Pattern, Location, neurotransmitter release, soma, neural cell body, neuronal cell body, homologous recombination, Structure, novel, sorting, Sorting - Cell Movement, Property, Genomics, Brain region, Data, Rat Strains, Regulatory Element, Resolution, Slice, Molecular, transcriptional signature, gene expression signature, gene expression pattern, Expression Signature, Gene Expression Profile, designing, design, Population, presynaptic, man, man's, mammalian genome, postsynaptic, genome-wide, genomewide, genome scale, transcriptome sequencing, RNAseq, RNA sequencing, RNA Seq, ATAC-seq, ATACseq, differential expression, transcriptional differences, differentially expressed, transcriptome, Knock-in, knockin, phenotypic data, neuropsychiatric disorder, neuropsychiatric disease,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent genetic advances have driven significant progress in scientists' abilities to classify and map neuronal cell types within the brains of mode organisms like laboratory mice. To better delineate neuronal cell types in the human brain, however, it is critical to have a deeper understanding of the way that neuronal cell types evolve across mammals. As a first step toward achieving this understanding, corresponding neuronal cell types will be directly compared in two closely related mammalian species: mice and rats. By closely examining differences in the properties of these cells, including the genes they express, we hope to identify genomic elements that control the properties of neuronal cell types, and to infer properties of the corresponding cell types in the human brain. Improving the precision with which we can classify human neuronal cell types could have a transformative impact on our ability to understand pathological changes in neuropsychiatric disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NELSON, SACHA B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>U01FD004503</grantId><grantName>ANALYSIS OF PDMP DATA ASSESSING IMPACT OF STATE INTERVENTION ON HIGH-RISK PRESCRI</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Food and Drug Administration</funderAgency><amount>150000.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-05</startDate><endDate>2017-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T90DA032435</grantId><grantName>Undergraduate and Graduate Training in Computational Neuroscience</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1611290.0</amount><startDate>2011-08-15</startDate><endDate>2021-08-31</endDate><keyword>Biology, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cognition, Computing Methodologies, computational methodology, computational methods, computer based method, computer methods, computing method, Data Analyses, Data Analysis, data interpretation, Disease, Disorder, Goals, Health, Human, Modern Man, Laboratory Research, Learning, Methods, Nervous system structure, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurosciences, Psychology, Research, Science, statistics, Students, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Training Programs, Universities, Work, Writing, career, computational neuroscience, Training, Individual, Funding, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, programs, Scientist, Techniques, Education and Training, Training and Education, experience, transdisciplinary collaboration, interdisciplinary collaboration, cohort, skills, graduate student, Modeling, Institution, Data, NRSA, National Research Service Awards, Senior Scientist, Molecular, designing, design, next generation, Faculty Education, Faculty Training, Teacher Education, Teacher Educator, Teacher Preparation, Teacher Training, faculty development, faculty professional development, instructor training, teacher development, Teacher Professional Development, undergraduate, undergraduate student, BigData, Big Data, model building, informal education, informal instruction, informal learning, Underrepresented Populations, Prospective cohort,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal is for a five-year renewal of a T90/R90 training program in
Computational Neuroscience at Brandeis University. The proposed program requests
funding to support 6 undergraduates, 4 NRSA eligible graduate students, and 2 non-
NRSA eligible graduate students each year. Our goal is to identify early career students
and provide them the formal and informal education and training they will need to
develop into the next generation of computational/quantitative neuroscientists. This is
particularly important in the upcoming era of “Big Data” as the techniques needed to
collect and analyze neuroscience data are becoming increasingly rigorous and
quantitative. The long-term goals and objectives are to increase the number of scientists
with strong quantitative and modeling skills in neuroscience, as this cohort will be
needed to understand brain function in health and disease. The 21 training faculty have
research expertise from human cognition to cellular and molecular neuroscience, so a
wide range of research problems, at numerous levels of analysis are available to trainees.
The training faculty were chosen because they have demonstrated commitment to the
use of theoretical and computational methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to
understand the nervous system in health and disease. Students will take courses in
statistics, data analysis, computational neuroscience, obtain skills in building models of
neurons, synapses, and networks, and employ these in a variety of independent research
projects. Two cohorts of prospective trainees will be targeted: 1) Individuals with strong
prior experience with quantitative methods who wish to work in neuroscience. 2)
Individuals in coming from psychology, neuroscience and biology who wish to learn to
employ quantitative and computational methods as part of their ability to tackle
important problems in neuroscience. In addition to course work and laboratory
research, students and trainees will be engaged in a large number of other activities
designed to enhance their speaking skills, writing skills, and ability to collaborate with
other scientists. All students and trainees will receive training in the responsible
conduct of science, and will interact with senior scientists at other institutions. Trainees
from underrepresented populations will be included.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MILLER, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32NS007292</grantId><grantName>Quantitative Neuroscience: Tools for Bridging Levels of Analysis</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>7531404.0</amount><startDate>1986-07-01</startDate><endDate>2026-06-30</endDate><keyword>Neurosciences, tool,</keyword><description>Project Summary
This is a proposal to continue a long-standing postdoctoral training program at Brandeis
University. This program integrates intensive quantitative and experimental training in a
collaborative environment to produce neuroscientists who go on to successful careers applying
these skills to solve the myriad problems posed by disorders of the nervous system. We will take
a diverse and talented set of individuals with Ph.D.s in neuroscience, physics, math, computer
science, engineering, and biological sciences and give them systematic and integrative training
in the use of modern quantitative/analytical approaches bridging levels of analysis to
understand nervous system function. We have designed a modular and collaborative training
structure that allows trainees with disparate backgrounds to acquire the skills, training and
flexibility they need to thrive as modern neuroscientists. Our program comprises a two-year
sequence that systematically builds quantitative literacy, fluency with statistical methods and
quantitative tools, training in rigor, experimental design and ethics, and grant-writing and
communication skills. We intend to recruit 4 Postdoctoral Trainees/year into this 2-year
program for a total of 8 slots, which maintains the previous level of support. We will magnify the
impact of this training program by encouraging all Neuroscience postdocs, not only those
appointed to the training grant, to participate. This will serve the purpose of building a
collaborative postdoc community that collectively possesses and disseminates a broad set of
quantitative skills, and where horizontal and vertical transmission of these skills will be an
important feature of training. The richer this trainee and mentor community is, the more
effective the training will be. To this end, we are committed to enhancing the diversity of our
training program at all levels, and a set of concrete steps to accomplish this are proposed.</description><investigator><investigatorId>TURRIGIANO, GINA G</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32MH019929</grantId><grantName>Neuroscience: From Channels to Behavior</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5535374.0</amount><startDate>1994-09-30</startDate><endDate>2024-06-30</endDate><keyword>Behavior, Neurosciences,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Over the 24 year tenure of this grant, Brandeis has built a multi-disciplinary program encompassing faculty in
Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Mathematics and Psychology. We educate students in the full range of
Neuroscience topics from the molecular biology of neuronal non-coding RNAs to the cognitive effects of aging.
Each member of our faculty collaborates with multiple others, and most projects involve several levels of
analysis. Our students are part of an intellectually and spatially integrated neuroscience community. The
resulting cohesion is reflected in every aspect of the program: coursework, rotations, thesis supervision, the
shared availability of advanced instrumentation and the collegiality of interactions.
The breadth of opportunity and interaction at Brandeis and close attention we pay to student progress allows
each student to develop according to her/his individual needs, and results in a low attrition rate. While we are a
relatively small program, over the last five years our program has graduated 18 students (3 of whom were
members of underrepresented minority groups). Our students graduate with excellent credentials and go on to
obtain positions in academia, health-care, government and industry that directly contribute to the NIH mandate
to benefit human health.
Our students enter Neuroscience from a remarkably wide variety of different backgrounds (Psychology,
Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics). A strong
aspect of our program has always been its emphasis on quantitative thinking. Every area of Neuroscience is
increasingly driven by large data sets and all Neuroscientists must be able to at least understand the principles
of their analysis. In this renewal we rethink our approach to quantitative literacy and propose a curricular
reform that will train our students in the fundamentals of quantitation rather than in specific high level methods.
By giving them computational tools and by teaching them to code, all of our students will have a solid
foundation for rigorous research at any level.
The program of course work, rotations, multiple small-group colloquia, proposition exams, and participation in
teaching necessarily consumes the bulk of a student's time during the first two years. They cannot (and we
would not want them to) have their laboratory research as their sole focus prior to their third year at Brandeis.
Therefore, they are not supported on research grants in these first critical years. This training grant provides
crucial funding to support students while they develop a broad set of intellectual skills. There are 22 mentors in
our program and we are requesting funds for 8 trainees.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32HS000062</grantId><grantName>AHRQ MULTI-DISCIPLINARY DOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</funderAgency><amount>3584574.0</amount><startDate>1994-09-30</startDate><endDate>2019-07-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM084907</grantId><grantName>Brain-Body-Behavior Interface in Learning and Development Across the Lifespan</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1486394.57</amount><startDate>2009-07-01</startDate><endDate>2019-08-31</endDate><keyword>Behavior, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Learning, Longevity, lifespan, life span, Length of Life, developmental, Development,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funds are requested to continue a pre-doctoral training program in the interface of behavioral and biomedical sciences, which was first funded in 2009. We request support for five trainees over a five year period.  The core training faculty are from the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Program at Brandeis University. Affiliated faculty are from the Brandeis Life Sciences, and adjunct faculty are from collaborating laboratories in the Greater Boston area. The faculty of this training program are firmly committed to educating students to study human behavioral health and development from the perspective of multi-directional, dynamic interactions among the biological building blocks of the body and brain and the emergent properties of whole individuals and groups of individuals. The training program we propose will be implemented within a Psychology Ph.D. program with strong, existing, intra- and inter-disciplinary research training, course work, and extra-curricular activities between the Psychology and Neuroscience programs.  Students in the training program will be required to fulfill the following requirements: 1) engage in rotations and research
projects co-mentored by one or more faculty working in both psychological and biomedical disciplines; 2) take courses from menus of psychological, biomedical, and general quantitative categories; 3) attend a variety of integrative proseminars and small and large group colloquium/discussion series; 4) participate in short courses during the academic year and the summer designed to promote unity and to provide advanced training in biomedical or computational techniques. Non-trainee Ph.D. students will also be encouraged to fulfill these requirements. Full participation of Psychology students in biomedical laboratories is a challenge which is being met by systematic introduction of these curricular elements as well as by selection of qualified candidates.  Adherence to and evaluation of the training program will be ensured by 1) annual internal reviews by the full core faculty of students' fulfillment of their gols as set out in a "contract" co-developed with the mentors; 2) annual reviews of the core faculty's guardianship by an internal steering committee and an external review committee; 3) feedback from students currently in the program and students who have graduated.  Our general approach to recruitment of students will be through direct outreach and networking. To recruit and retain minority students, we will build upon the successful methods of our colleagues who are directing successful training grants in Psychology and Life Sciences at Brandeis</description><investigator><investigatorId>SEKULER, ROBERT </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM007596</grantId><grantName>Macromolecular Structure Mechanism</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2683030.0</amount><startDate>1978-07-01</startDate><endDate>2020-06-30</endDate><keyword>Macromolecular Structure, Molecular Structure,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Training Program provides graduate students with advanced education in the principles and practice of macromolecular chemistry, mechanism, and structure. All aspects of the program - formal course curriculum, laboratory rotations, informal specialized area-interest seminars, and intensive research in laboratories operating on the edge of discovery - are aimed at the question: how do biological macromolecules work? How do proteins, membranes, nucleic acids, and high-order complexes of these huge molecules use physical-chemical and structural principles to act in the enormous variety of contexts that underlie biological function? The Training Program provides support for selected students in the Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Biophysics at Brandeis University. This is a flexible PhD program designed for two broad types of students: those with strong quantitative backgrounds but who may have weaker prior training experience in biological chemistry, and those with more traditional training in biochemistry and cell biology. Our intention is to bring these two groups of students to the same end-point and to prepare them for careers in basic research. Currently, 3 students (which will rise to 35 students in September '14) are enrolled in this Ph.D. program; the Training Program includes 26 participating faculty (in four departments) working in the following areas: macromolecular structure determination by x-ray crystallography and NMR, mechanistic enzymology, membrane transport and ion channel mechanisms, single-molecule analysis, high- resolution mass spectroscopy and proteomics, computational biophysics, protein evolution.</description><investigator><investigatorId>OPRIAN, DANIEL D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32GM007122</grantId><grantName>Genetic and Biochemical Mechanisms of Regulation</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4752821.0</amount><startDate>1975-07-01</startDate><endDate>2021-08-31</endDate><keyword>Biochemical, Genetic, Regulation,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will support the training of eight students annually at Brandeis University in the field of genetics, most of whom will be appointed in the second year of their Ph. D. training. Students will be engaged in genetics research relating to molecular, cell, and developmental biology and neuroscience, with relevance to the mechanisms and treatment of human disease. The Training Grant Faculty are drawn from highly collaborative and interdisciplinary researchers in the Departments of Biology, Biochemistry and Chemistry. Students work in well-funded and productive laboratories that are supported by recently upgraded core facilities in DNA and protein analysis, proteomics, genomics, microscopy and mouse and viral transgenics. The proposed program emphasizes rigorous training to develop research and other skills including scientific literacy, writing and oal communication and quantitative approaches. The Ph. D. program has a core curriculum of molecular biology, cell biology and ethics and advanced genetics courses, which includes molecular genetics, neurogenetics, population genetics and genomics, epigenetics and human genetics. These core courses are supplemented by elective courses in biochemistry, structural biology, developmental biology, mathematical modeling or neuroscience and courses concerning human diseases such as cancer, infectious disease, neurological and development disorders. Trainees are appointed based on the strength of their academic records and research potential and are supported for two years. Their progress is closely monitored by a committee of Training Grant Faculty selected for each student. Qualifying examinations at the end of the first and second years provide a means to evaluate each student's ability to frame questions and propose research solutions in their emerging area of expertise and in an outside field. The training of students is supplemented by seminars and journal clubs, featuring a wide variety of successful investigators in diverse areas of biological research. Professional development activities feature individual development plans and valuable personal discussions that assist each student's career planning. A new facet of the program is the expansion of skills workshops, aimed at enhancing trainees' master of specific quantitative approaches and fellowship/grant writing skills. Special opportunities for Trainees include enhanced personal interactions with speakers and participation in an annual Genetics Symposium. In addition, Trainees work with Training faculty in the planning and implementation of these activities. The program is assessed yearly through online surveys and personal discussions with Trainees. This, and the small size and interconnectedness of students and faculty, provides training responsive to the needs of each student in a first-class research setting.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LOVETT, SUSAN THOMAS</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32EB009419</grantId><grantName>Quantitative Biology</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2781179.0</amount><startDate>2009-07-01</startDate><endDate>2019-08-31</endDate><keyword>Biology,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The second half of the last century produced a staggering wealth of information about the cellular and molecular processes of life. The quantity and quality of this data is ushering in a new mode of thinking in the biomedical sciences that relies heavily on mathematical and computational tools and on rigorous quantitative experimental methods. With increasing frequency, these analytical tools and experimental methods are not home grown within the life sciences, but are adopted from research in the physical and mathematical sciences. This brave new world requires a new kind of researcher, one who easily moves between the bench and the workstation, one who is equally at ease with running microscopes as with running simulations, and one for whom building quantitative models and testing them by designing equally quantitative experiments comes naturally.  The Quantitative Biology (QB) Program at Brandeis University brings together six different Ph.D. programs from five science departments in order to train students who can rise to this interdisciplinary challenge. QB is an official interdepartmental graduate program at Brandeis that has just completed its seventh full academic year of operation; the program currently has 50 enrolled students and is the largest graduate program in the sciences at Brandeis. QB leverages the strengths of existing disciplinary Ph.D. programs at Brandeis by bringing together students from these programs in a specialized curriculum that is designed to take advantage of the learning opportunities afforded by training in multi-disciplinary groups. Students admitted to graduate study in the Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology, Neuroscience, or Physics Ph.D. programs who choose the QB track, receive upon successful completion a Ph.D. degree in their chosen discipline "with an additional specialization in Quantitative Biology". This approach provides the students with modern discipline-bridging training while providing the graduate with a Ph.D. credential that has proven value on the job market because it is in a recognized traditional discipline. Students typically enter the QB program in either the first or second years of their Ph.D. studies and remain affiliated with QB until they graduate. Each student selected for support by the training grant is supported either in years one and two, or two and three, so as to achieve the best fit between QB training and the course of study in the student's home Ph.D. program.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GELLES, JEFF </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32AG000204</grantId><grantName>Training in Cognitive Aging in a Social Context</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1366566.0</amount><startDate>1990-07-01</startDate><endDate>2017-04-30</endDate><keyword>Social Environment, socioenvironment, social context, social climate, Training, Cognitive aging,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funds are requested for support of three predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees in Cognitive Aging in a Social Context at Brandeis University. The core training faculty consists of nine faculty members in the Psychology Department who form the nucleus of the training program, supported by affiliated faculty. Additional off-site training opportunities are made possible by the rich environment of the greater Boston area and the university's commitment to training and research for the benefit of older Americans. The goal of the program is to provide strong, integrated training in the cognitive and social psychology of aging, within a life- span developmental perspective. The training program, however, is designed to go beyond a simple focus on cognitive or social aging. Rather, our program is predicated on a belief in the critical need for graduate and postdoctoral training that emphasizes the intersection of cognitive and socioemotional factors, and the increasingly recognized importance of stress reactivity and stress regulation to health and cognition in adulthood and later life.  Predoctoral trainees will be admitted through either the existing graduate programs in Social and Developmental Psychology or in Cognitive Neuroscience. Predoctoral students' progress and performance will be biannually evaluated by the procedures of the program in which they are enrolled, and by the training program core faculty. Postdoctoral trainees will have free access to all courses offered in the university and will work closely with a primary plus a secondary preceptor to foster the integration of cognitive, social, and health perspectives in their training. Training will be carried out in the laboratories housed in the Psychology Department and Volen National Center for Complex Systems at Brandeis University. In addition to the core faculty's focus on socioemotional, cognitive aging and health processes, considerable expertise also exists within the department and the Volen Center in social and developmental psychology, statistics, research methods, computational modeling, neuropsychology and cognitive science. We are thus able to draw on the expertise of colleagues throughout Brandeis University as well as within the greater Boston area through established collaborative arrangements that provide additional training opportunities.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WINGFIELD, ARTHUR </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>T32AA007567</grantId><grantName>Doctoral Training/Alcohol-Related Health Services Research</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5114661.0</amount><startDate>1994-09-15</startDate><endDate>2027-08-31</endDate><keyword>Alcohols, Alcohol Chemical Class, Health Services Research, Health Services Evaluation, Medical Care Research, services research, Training,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 The Doctoral Training Program in Alcohol-Related Health Services Research at the Heller School at
Brandeis University prepares students to become scholars in alcohol-related health services research for
teaching and research careers in universities, government agencies, research organizations and major service
delivery systems. It has been an integral part of the Ph.D. in Social Policy program at the Heller School since
its beginning in 1994. We focus on how organization, management, financing and payment make a difference
in the effective delivery of prevention, treatment and recovery services for alcohol problems. We specifically
focus on how these factors intersect with how disparate and vulnerable populations face unique barriers to
these services. In this competitive renewal, which requests nine predoctoral training slots for the next five-
year cycle, the successful leadership and program structure and content of the current multi-disciplinary
training program is maintained. We include an explicit plan to enhance the diversity of the applicant pool.
Typically, three new students enter the program each year and are supported for three years.
 The educational goals of the training program function at the intersection of three domains: theory,
applied research, and policy. A rigorous multi-disciplinary education that includes several alcohol courses in
the behavioral health concentration, intensive discipline-based mentoring to guide trainees as they develop
and conduct dissertations that incorporate alcohol topics, and hands-on alcohol-related research experience
combine to provide these trainees with the skills and knowledge needed to be successful alcohol-related
health services researchers. The doctoral program at the Heller School constitutes the foundation of the
educational program of the alcohol-related services research training program, which is housed in the
behavioral health concentration. It adds the specialization in services research and policy analysis in the field
of alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. It is sequenced to provide broad substantive knowledge regarding
the evolution of and current issues in major policy areas relevant to alcohol use disorders, advanced training in
the principles of research design and statistical reasoning, experience in the conduct of applied research, and
directed study through the dissertation on a topic related to alcohol services. Collaborations with local research
organizations and universities expand research opportunities.
 We are committed to recruiting a diverse pool of trainees who have real-world experience in a variety of
settings, who bring a depth and breadth of knowledge to the Heller School experience and to research and
social policy analysis, and who are able to link their research foundation with real-world service delivery. The
progress and commitment of the current and former trainees of the Heller Doctoral Training Program in
Alcohol-Related Health Services Research provide evidence for success.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HORGAN, CONSTANCE M.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>SLMAQM16GR1045</grantId><grantName>ARTS EXHIBITION FOR THE U.S. PAVILION DURING THE 2017 BIENNALE IN VENICE, ITALY: MARK BRADFORD, TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY</grantName><funderCode>19</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of State</funderAgency><amount>245978.0</amount><startDate>2016-05-02</startDate><endDate>2018-04-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R90DA033463</grantId><grantName>Undergraduate and Graduate Training in Computational Neuroscience</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2022457.0</amount><startDate>2011-08-15</startDate><endDate>2021-08-31</endDate><keyword>Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Disease, Disorder, Health, Methods, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, statistics, computational neuroscience, Training, tool, programs, cohort, graduate student, Modeling, undergraduate, undergraduate student,</keyword><description>Health Relevance

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activity-dependent synaptic modifications (LTP/LTD) are the leading candidate for the mechanism of memory. LTP involves induction, maintenance, and expression processes. This proposal seeks to elucidate the maintenance processes that store memory information. The critical test of any hypothesis regarding memory maintenance is the "erasure test" in which an inhibitor is applied after LTP/memory is established. If this blocks
LTP/memory and the effect persists after the inhibitor is removed, the inhibitor must have erased a maintenance process. We have conducted the erasure test using an inhibitor of CaMKII (CN-peptide). We found that application of this peptide after LTP induction produced erasure of saturated LTP. Moreover, after LTP was erased, LTP could be reinduced, indicating that plasticity mechanisms remained intact. The overall goal of this proposal is to conduct further critical tests of the role of CaMKII in maintenance of LTP and to extend this work by examining the role of CaMKII in the maintenance of behavioral memory. Memory maintenance is likely to depend on many different processes. The results of the proposed work could provide the first strong evidence identifying one of these processes. The goal of Aim 1 is to test a specific variant of the CaMKII hypothesis. Biochemical experiments show that activation of CaMKII causes it to bind to the NMDAR. We have shown that CN-peptide, a peptide that produces a reduction in the complex, reverses LTP. These results suggest that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex forms during LTP and is responsible for the maintenance of LTP. However, there have been no previous methods for monitoring the complex dynamics at synapses during and after LTP induction. Thus, crucial information regarding the complex formation and persistence is lacking. We have developed and validated a novel optical method based on FLIM-FRET. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates that LTP induction produces complex formation in spines and that the formation is synapse specific. We will determine the duration of the complex under conditions that either induce short-lasting LTP (early LTP) or produce both early and late LTP. We will also examine how the duration of the complex depends on factors that enhance (e.g., BDNF) or prevent (e.g., protein synthesis inhibitors) late LTP. These experiments will provide a strong test of whether the complex has the persistence required to be a molecular memory. The goal of Aim 2 is to conduct the erasure test at the behavioral level. We will use conditioned place aversion, a hippocampal-dependent form of memory. After learning is achieved, HSV virus will be used to deliver a dominant-negative form of CaMKII (K42M) to the CA1 region, producing transient (several-day) expression of this mutant kinase. Memory retention will then be tested a week later. Our preliminary results indicate that this form of behavioral memory can be erased by this procedure. In additional experiments, we will test the more specific hypothesis that behavioral memory is dependent on the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR (or other PSD proteins to which CaMKII binds).</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R56NS036853</grantId><grantName>Synaptic homeostasis in neocortical neurons</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>403497.0</amount><startDate>1997-09-30</startDate><endDate /><keyword>Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Reactive Site, Combining Site, Binding Sites, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Endocytosis, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Epilepsy, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, Health, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, In Vitro, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Reagent, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Rodent, social role, Role, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, visual cortical, Visual Cortex, Weight, Measures, Dissociation, Lateral, Surface, Diffuse, Physiologic, Physiological, Visual, Ligand Binding Protein, Binding Proteins, Attenuated, tool, scaffolding, scaffold, Nature, Life, restoration, neurodegenerative illness, degenerative neurological diseases, degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neuro-degenerative Disorders, Neural degenerative Disorders, Neural Degenerative Diseases, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, Neurodegenerative Disorders, interest, Receptor Protein, receptor, trafficking, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, neural circuit, Modeling, response, Drops, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Binding (Molecular Function), TIF2, NCOA2, GRIP1, NCOA2 gene, Defect, Affinity, biophysical mechanism, Biophysical Process, Resolution, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, Monitor, Molecular, Process, imaging, Image, excitatory neuron, Outcome, scale up, Synaptic plasticity, Impairment, neocortical, synapse function, synaptic function, treatment design, intervention design, therapy design, postsynaptic,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homeostatic synaptic scaling is an important form of plasticity thought to be essential for maintaining stable function in developing neural circuits.

Extensive study of HIV+ individuals in recent years has brought to light many examples of antibodies that
can neutralize a broad range of HIV strains and protect against viral challenge in animal models of
infection. The portion of viral surface most commonly targeted by such antibodies is now known to be
the “high-mannose patch”: among patients producing broadly-neutralizing antibodies, 38% target this
one region of the virus. One of the most potent high mannose patch antibodies, PGT128, binds to a
particular arrangement of high-mannose glycans and conserved peptide residues. Our goal is to develop
vaccine immunogens which mimic this arrangement precisely and be used to elicit PGT128-like
antibodies.
Our approach will utilize unique directed evolution methods to develop glycopeptide immunogens in
which PGT128 epitope elements are correctly reconstituted. It is also possible that additional
immunogens will be required to correctly prime the immune response by stimulating germline precursors
of PGT128. Therefore, we will develop glycopeptides targeting both mature and germline PGT128
antibodies. In collaboration with David Nemazee at Scripps, we will investigate the ability of these
glycopeptides in combination, to activate a germline PGT128 response that can mature into a response
with broadly-neutralizing PGT128-like specificity.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R40MC30754</grantId><grantName>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH FIELD-INITIATED RESEARCH PROGRAM</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Health Resources and Services Administration</funderAgency><amount>100000.0</amount><startDate>2017-04-01</startDate><endDate>2019-03-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R40MC27472</grantId><grantName>MCH RESEARCH</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Health Resources and Services Administration</funderAgency><amount>96464.0</amount><startDate>2014-09-01</startDate><endDate>2015-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R37NS092635</grantId><grantName>Synaptic Homeostasis in Neocortical Neurons and Circuits</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1617971.0</amount><startDate>2015-07-15</startDate><endDate>2019-06-30</endDate><keyword>Autistic Disorder, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autism, Automobile Driving, driving, Binding Sites, Reactive Site, Combining Site, Biophysics, biophysical sciences, biophysical principles, biophysical foundation, Endocytosis, Epilepsy, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Equilibrium, balance function, balance, Homeostasis, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, In Vitro, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, nervous system disorder, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Play, Reagent, Rodent, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Role, social role, Synapses, synapse, Synaptic, Testing, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, Weight, Measures, Dissociation, Lateral, Surface, Diffuse, Physiologic, Physiological, Visual, bound protein, Protein Binding, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Ligand Binding Protein, Binding Proteins, Attenuated, tool, scaffold, scaffolding, Nature, restoration, Neurodegenerative Disorders, neurodegenerative illness, degenerative neurological diseases, degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neural degenerative Disorders, Neural Degenerative Diseases, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, interest, receptor, Receptor Protein, trafficking, neural circuit, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, Modeling, response, Drops, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Defect, Affinity, Biophysical Process, biophysical mechanism, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, Monitor, Molecular, Process, excitatory neuron, Outcome, scale up, Synaptic plasticity, Impairment, neocortical, synapse function, synaptic function, treatment design, intervention design, therapy design, postsynaptic, public health relevance, Glutamate Receptor-Interacting Protein 1, GRIP1, GRIP1 gene, brain health, high resolution imaging, experimental research, experiment, experimental study, imaging approach,</keyword><description>﻿

Despite years of work on individual brain signaling systems, the organizational principles underlying neuromodulation remain incompletely understood. The proposed work will employ the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system to address a series of general questions about neuromodulation of brain circuits. Mass spectrometry will be used to determine the identity of neuropeptides in specific sensory and modulatory neurons. The function of the specific neuropeptides found in identified neurons will be examined electrophysiologically. In cases in which multiple members of a peptide family are found in the same identified neurons, the potency and action of the different family members will be compared. To determine how a single neuron organizes receptors for 12 or 15 different neurotransmitters or modulators, neurons will be filled with fluorescent dye, and agonists applied to various regions of the neuron to localize its receptors. Further experiments will characterize the voltage-dependence and pharmacological profile of the evoked responses. The effects of neuromodulators on circuit reorganization will be studied with quantitative methods that determine how different frequency rhythms interact. Additionally, the effects of neuromodulators on signal propagation will be investigated by determining the extent to which externally imposed signals (sine waves of various frequencies) influence the activity of circuit neurons. Together these data will contribute to basic understandings of how different neuromodulatory systems can modify networks to produce behaviorally relevant changes in function.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MARDER, EVE E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R37GM056223</grantId><grantName>Genetic analysis of sensory specification in C.elegans</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2555241.0</amount><startDate>1997-07-01</startDate><endDate>2018-06-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, autophagy, Autophagocytosis, Cell Body, Cells, Cilia, Disorder, Disease, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, Exhibits, Future, Genes, Genetic Screening, Goals, Grant, Housing, Injections, Injection of therapeutic agent, Transmembrane Protein Gene, Transmembrane Protein, Intrinsic Membrane Protein, Integral Membrane Protein, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Mammalia, Mammals, Electron Microscopy, Micro-tubule, Microtubules, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, nerve cement, Non-neuronal cell, Neuroglial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Glial Cells, Glia, Neuroglia, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, Organelles, Phenotype, Proteins, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Testing, Work, Generations, Caenorhabditis elegans, C.elegans, C elegans, related to A and C-protein, rac protein kinase, proto-oncogene protein akt, proto-oncogene protein RAC, c-akt protein, RAC-PK protein, Protein Kinase B, Akt protein, AKT, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, base, Distal, Biochemical, Link, basal body, kinetosome, insight, Funding, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Functional disorder, Therapeutic, Genetic, Morphology, Life, Frequencies, Complex, Sensory, cell type, membrane structure, Membrane, mutant, Protein Trafficking, protein transport, trafficking, Structure, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Protein Gene Products, Gene Proteins, MAP kinase, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, MAPK ERK Kinases, MAP-ERK Kinase, MEKs, Genetic analyses, genetic analysis, ciliogenesis, cilium biogenesis, Molecular Interaction, Binding, stress-activated protein kinase 1, jun-NH2-Terminal Kinase, c-jun N-Terminal Kinase, Stress-Activated Protein Kinase gamma, Stress-Activated Protein Kinase JNK1, SAPK1/JNK, SAPK1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, SAPK/JNK, SAP Kinase-1, PRKM8, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8, MAPK8 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, MAPK8, MAP Kinase 8 Gene, MAP Kinase 8, JNK21B1/2, JNK1A2, JNK1 protein, JNK1 Kinase, JNK1, JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, JNK, JN Kinase, C-jun N-Terminal Kinase 1, C-jun Kinase-1, C-jun Amino-Terminal Kinase, MAPK8 gene, Defect, Mammalian Cell, Resolution, Retrieval, Phosphorylation Site, Signaling Molecule, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, imaging, Image, pathway, Pathway interactions, Instruction, electron tomography, reconstruction, knockdown, knock-down, three dimensional structure, 3D structure, 3-dimensional structure, 3-D structure, ciliopathy,</keyword><description>Many sensory neurons contain nnicrotubule-based structures called primary cilia which exhibit highly
 specialized and unique morphologies. Sensory cilia house signaling molecules, and their complex structures
 are essential for signal transduction. Little is known about the mechanisms by which ciliary structural
 diversity is generated and maintained. A subset of sensory neurons in C. elegans is ciliated, and many of
these neurons exhibit elaborate ciliary architecture. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the
 mechanisms that generate and maintain cell-specific specialized cilia. In work funded by this grant, we have
 identified and characterized multiple mechanisms underlying the generation of unique ciliary structures in C.
 elegans. We showed that cilia morphology is sculpted via a tight balance between membrane delivery and
 retrieval by exocytic and endocytic mechanisms, identified several new molecules required for ciliogenesis in
 a defined subset of sensory neurons, showed that the roles of at least one of these molecules in regulating
 ciliogenesis is conserved in mammals, identified diverse molecular mechanisms that act in a protein- and
 cell-specific manner to traffic ciliary transmembrane proteins, and completed an exhaustive compendium of
 the ultrastructures, and reconstructions of 3D structures, of 50 of 60 C. elegans sensory cilia at high
 resolution using serial section electron microscopy and tomography.
 In the next funding period we propose to: 1) Characterize the role of the conserved multidomain
 cytoskeietal protein Girdin in regulating ciliogenesis in C. elegans and mammalian cells, 2) Investigate the
function ofthe non-canonical MAP kinase MAPK15/ERK8 in specialized cilia formation, and 3) Identify new
 mechanisms of ciliary protein trafficking and microtubule dynamics via characterization of molecules that
 regulate the complex ciliary arborization of a sensory neuron type.
 Ciliary dysfunction is causal to a plethora of cellular and systemic disorders called ciliopathies. Given
 the remarkable conservation of ciliogenic mechanisms across species, results from this work are expected to
 lead to new insights into potential therapeutic strategies to target these disorders.
 RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 Primary cilia are specialized structures that are present on many cell types and that maintain cellular and
 organismal function. Ciliary dysfunction results in a range of disorders called ciliopathies. The molecules
required for cilia formation and function are highly conserved. We will identify and characterize genes
required for cilia formation in the model system C. elegans. Insights from this work will be directly relevant to

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ever since enzymes were first discovered, the question of how they achieve their remarkable catalytic proficiency has fascinated both chemists and biologists. This project aims to find general answers to this question for a particular class of enzymes: those that catalyze the transfer of a hydrogen ion, either a proton or a hydride, between parts of a substrate and between the enzyme and the substrate. Our focus on hydrogen stems from the fact that proton or hydride transfers occur as a part of nearly every enzymatic reaction, yet efficient transfer from or to an inactivated carbon or oxygen species is very difficult to accomplish non-enzymatically. For over two decades we have probed this question by a combination of protein crystallography, computational approaches, and site-directed mutagenesis. Along the way we have developed a number of techniques of general use in crystallography, structural biology, and drug discovery. Our studies have revealed the following general principles: (1) Enzymatic catalysis of proton transfer depends on perturbed pKa values for the groups involved. Consider a catalytic base. It appears that the basic nature of this group is increased, perhaps either by shielding it from the solvent or by placing an appropriately charged residue near it, although the mechanism of perturbation has not been proven in most cases. Enzymes also activate the substrate (i.e., increase the acidity of the carbon or oxygen acid) in two ways: by polarization, usually by hydrogen bond donation to a substrate oxygen atom, and by electrostatic stabilization of transition states. (2) Enzymatic catalysis of hydride transfer depends on proximity and orientation. Coenzyme strain does not appear to play a major role. Shielding of the substrate and/or cofactor from solvent does not seem to be essential, although it does occur sometimes. Polarization by, e.g., a metal ion can activate a substrate for hydride abstraction and donation, but often there is no obvious activation involved. For this renewal, we wish to focus on a set of questions that we believe have not been answered conclusively by any experiments or calculation. The questions are: (1) How are the catalytic acids and bases perturbed by the protein environment? (2) Do directed fluctuations (promoting vibrations) play a significant role in catalysis? To answer these questions we have selected several enzymes as model systems: four that catalyze proton transfer and three that catalyze both hydride and proton transfers. The specific methods we will employ include ultra-high resolution X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, combined QM/MM calculations, site-directed mutagenesis plus kinetic analysis, and a novel method for perturbing protein dynamics by binding ligands to sites remote from the active site.  PUBLICE HEALTH RELEVANCE We are trying to understand how the environment of an enzyme makes difficult chemical reactions occur at blinding speed; such reactions are essential for every living cell, yet we don't understand all of the factors that go into producing this extraordinary chemical achievement. We have selected a particular class of reactions for study, and have devised a research plan that makes use of a large number of experimental and computational techniques to dissect what the protein is doing in each case to facilitate the chemistry. If we are successful, the principles we uncover could lead to the design of artificial enzymes for industrial and medical use.

repair to genomic instability. This proposal continues the study of DSB repair by the most common pathway 
- gene conversion - in the model system, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A detailed analysis 
of DSB repair is made possible by rapidly inducing a single DSB in all cells of the population, using a 
galactose-inducible HO endonuclease to effect mating-type (MAT) gene switching. Physical analysis of DNA 
solated from cells undergoing recombination, by southern blot and PCR analysis, makes it possible to 
identify intermediates of recombination, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) permits one to flow the 
recruitment of recombination proteins in both wild type and cells lacking various recombination and DNA 
replication proteins. It is proposed to continue our analysis of early steps in homologous recombination, 
ncluding the characterization of strand invasion intermediates and the defects of mutant recombination 
proteins. The dynamics of homology searching will be investigated, using microscopic analysis of 
fluorescently-tagged segments adjacent to chromosomal regions undergoing recombination, as well as by 
Chip. Special attention will be given to the role of the cis-acting Recombination Enhancer. A detailed 
analysis of new DNA synthesis during gene conversion will be performed, including a study of recruitment of 
DNA polymerases to the strand invasion intermediate. Another finding that will be pursued concerns a 
1000-fold increase in the rate of mutagenesis by template switching during gene conversion. The role of 
DNA processivity factors and helicases will be examined to identify the basis of template switching. In 
addition, the analysis of changes in chromatin structure accompanying MST switching will be pursued, using 
a modified MAT locus that allows the analysis of chromatin alterations and reestablishment during repair and 
the analysis of chromatin chaperones and remodelers. A second major theme of this proposal is to 
understand the role of the Recombination Enhancer (RE) in regulating the mating-type dependent choice of 
one of two alternative donors during MAT switching. The role of the phospho-threonine binding HA domain 
of Fkhl, which has been shown to be essential for donor preference when bound at RE, will be investigated. 
Identification of the phospho-threonine target in the region around the DSB will be carried out, both by 
characterization of the FHA domain and by analysis of DSB-dependent proteins that associate with the FHA 
domain.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HABER, JAMES E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35NS097343</grantId><grantName>Neuromodulation and Robustness of Neurons and Networks</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>6722597.0</amount><startDate>2016-12-01</startDate><endDate>2024-11-30</endDate><keyword>Animals, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Crustacean, Crustacea, Future, Ganglia, Neural Ganglion, Goals, Human, Modern Man, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Ion Channel, Ionic Channels, Membrane Channels, Membrane Proteins, Membrane Protein Gene, Membrane-Associated Proteins, Surface Proteins, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Temperature, Time, Work, Measures, biologic, Biological, Neuromodulator Receptors, Individual, Funding, receptor, Receptor Protein, neuroregulation, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, Regulation, Modeling, response, Address, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, flexibility, flexible, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, Computer Models, Computerized Models, computational modeling, computational models, computer based models, computerized modeling, Compensation,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 This is a request to consolidate three ongoing NINDS-funded proposals that deal
with neuromodulation (R37 NS 17813), temperature compensation (R01 NS 81012), and
computational models of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability (Project #4 of
P01 NS07949). Together these projects comprise a coherent attempt to understand
brain circuit stability in the face of: a) extensive neuromodulation, b) constant and rapid
turnover of ion channels and receptors, and c) degenerate and multiple solutions at the
single neuron and circuit level. These questions arise from years of computational and
experimental work using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion
(STG), but address general problems relevant to all nervous systems, from invertebrates
to humans. Future experiments will combine experimental and computational work to
understand the correlations in biological parameters in neurons and networks that allow
any given parameter to be variable while the circuit itself retains robustness. Animal to
animal variability in response to perturbations will be measured, the strengths of all of
the synapses in STG circuits will be measured, and the regulation of multiple
neuromodulator receptors by single neurons will be studied. Additionally, self-tuning
models will be developed to find sets of neuronal parameters that allow neurons to
maintain stability in response to perturbations. This work will illuminate the extent to
which the same animal can potentially generate similar behavior by substantially
different (degenerate) circuit mechanisms at different times. If so, this can shed light on
how larger circuits may switch between a number of degenerate circuit mechanisms to
generate stable behaviors over time.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MARDER, EVE E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R35GM122463</grantId><grantName>Mechanisms of sensory neuron morphological diversification, signaling, and functional plasticity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4399865.0</amount><startDate>2017-05-01</startDate><endDate>2027-07-31</endDate><keyword>Adhesions, Animals, Architecture, Engineering / Architecture, Award, Behavior, Behavior Disorders, behavioral disorder, Cilia, Cognition Disorders, cognitive disease, cognitive disorder, cognitive syndrome, Communication, Cues, Disease, Disorder, Gene Expression, Goals, Head, Recording of previous events, History, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Nematodes, roundworm, Nematoda, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, Nervous system structure, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Sensory Neurons, Afferent Neurons, Play, Research, social role, Role, Sense Organs, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Temperature, Testing, Translating, Work, Caenorhabditis elegans, C elegans, C. elegans, C.elegans, base, Area, Variant, Variation, Training, insight, Individual, analog, Funding, Collaborations, Morphology, Shapes, programs, cell biology, Cellular biology, Scientist, Complex, Sensory, Pattern, experience, sensory mechanism, synergism, Structure, novel, Coding System, Code, Regulation, Property, response, Defect, NIGMS, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Resolution, in vivo, Process, Modification, Development, developmental, Neurodevelopmental Disorder, Neurological Development Disorder, Behavioral, Pathway interactions, pathway, Gene Expression Profile, Expression Signature, gene expression pattern, gene expression signature, transcriptional profile, transcriptional signature, environmental change, next generation, innovation, innovate, innovative, public health relevance, functional plasticity, behavioral plasticity,</keyword><description>The overall goal of our NIGMS-funded research program is to identify and characterize the mechanisms that
allow individual sensory neurons to sense and respond to defined environmental cues, and to modulate these
responses based on experience and context. The lab explores these issues in two independent but related
areas. In the first, we study how individual sensory neuron types acquire their specialized sensory cilia
morphologies. In the second, we study how the morphologies and functions of sensory neurons are modulated
by experience. With R35 funding, we have been able to build synergies between these research areas and to
extend our work in unanticipated directions. A first major goal for the upcoming period will be to build on our
work in ciliogenic mechanisms to investigate how the organization of neuronal cilia within a sense organ, as
well as interciliary contacts, contribute to shaping sensory neuron functions. We previously showed that
sensory cilia are stereotypically organized within a head sense organ in C. elegans; the mechanisms that
underlie this organization and the functional consequences of this patterning are unknown. We will determine
whether an adhesion code regulates interciliary contacts and organization, and explore how these contacts
regulate neuronal communication and function. A second major goal will be to investigate how temperature
experience reshapes the complex morphologies of the AFD thermosensory neuron pair in C. elegans. The
architecture of the AFD sensory endings is regulated by neuronal activity and plays a critical role in the ability
of these neurons to adapt and respond to environmental temperature variations. We will exploit our expertise in
neuronal cell biology and high-resolution analyses of sensory behaviors and sensory neuron responses to
describe how the shape of the AFD sensory endings is modified as a function of the animal’s experience, and
how this modification in turn modulates AFD function. A third major goal will be to investigate how the
experience of an analog variable such as temperature is translated into graded gene expression changes in a
single sensory neuron type in vivo, and how these gene expression changes in turn influence neuronal
properties. We plan to establish whether the gene expression pattern in a neuron encodes its temporal activity
history, identify the required regulatory mechanisms, and assess the consequences on neuronal functions. Our
multifaceted experimental approach will allow us to generate a comprehensive description of how activity and
experience intersect with developmental pathways to modify sensory neuron structure and function, thereby
generating appropriate behavioral plasticity. This award will also enable us to continue to train the next
generation of scientists, to establish new collaborations, and to generate and test innovative and novel
hypotheses. Given the conservation of sensory and ciliogenic mechanisms, we expect that findings from this
work will be broadly generalizable, and may provide insights into how altered regulation of neuronal structural
and functional plasticity leads to disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>SENGUPTA, PIALI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R34DA037039</grantId><grantName>Preventing Prescription Drug Problems: A Pilot Military Opioid Safety Initiative</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>619723.0</amount><startDate>2013-09-15</startDate><endDate>2017-08-31</endDate><keyword>Adoption, adulthood, adult human (21+), Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Afghanistan, Alcohol Chemical Class, Alcohols, Behavior, Censuses, Communities, Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical, Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical, Drug Screening, Preclinical Drug Evaluation, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Education, Educational aspects, Medical Education, Environment, Family, Future, Goals, Community Hospitals, Iraq, Literature, Military, Armed Forces Personnel, Military Personnel, Statex SR, Roxanol, Oramorph SR, Oramorph, Morphinan-3,6-diol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methyl- (5alpha,6alpha)-, Morphia, MSir, MS Contin, Kadian, Infumorph, Morphine, Overdose, Patients, Pharmacists, Physicians, pilot study, Pilot Projects, Drug Prescribing, Drug Prescriptions, Primary Care Physician, healthcare quality, health care quality, recruit, Recruitment Activity, Research Resources, Resources, Risk, Safety, South Carolina, Testing, Veterans Affairs (U.S.), Veterans Administration, United States Veterans Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Universities, Veterans, County, Measures, Drug Monitoring, Family member, Outcome Measure, Schedule, work setting, work environment, Worksite, Work-Site, Work Place, Work Location, Job Site, Job Setting, Job Place, Job Location, Job Environment, Workplace, base, improved, Opioid, Training Intervention, instructional intervention, Instruction Intervention, Education for Intervention, Educational Intervention, Community Physician, programs, milligram, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Visit, Medical center, prescription drug misuse, misuse of prescription only drugs, Practice Management, member, outreach, Prevention, Reporting, retired person, retired people, retiree, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Effectiveness, preventing, prevent, Dose, Academic Detailing, Data, Educational Materials, enroll, Enrollment, Monitor, designing, design, Outcome, Population, innovative, innovate, innovation, drug detection, drug testing, high risk, public health relevance, secondary outcome, clinical practice, overdose death, randomized trial, arm,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brandeis University and University of South Carolina (SC) are proposing a pilot study, the SC Opioid Safety Initiative - Military (SCOSI-M) study, that will focus on increasing the use of safe prescribing and prescription monitoring practices among primary care physicians. We will design an innovative educational intervention using an academic detailing approach that has military/veteran-specific content and is targeted to physicians treating military personnel and veterans. This project fills a gap because currently, no
academic detailing programs specific to controlled substances are in the literature. A second innovation is that we will promote the use of the SC prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) as one of the educational objectives. This increases the study's significance and potential generalizability, as state PDMP programs are widespread and have been shown to reduce diversion of controlled substances. Their effectiveness in improving quality of health care is hindered; however, as very few prescribers use them. The overall aim of SCOSI-M is to prevent the onset or progression of prescription drug problems among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, military members, and their families who are at high risk for developing problems if their treatment involves long-term use of an opioid. The specific aims are to: Aim 1. Design an educational outreach intervention based on academic detailing (i.e., SCOSI-M) for physicians with content specific to prescription drug problems among veterans, military members, and their families. Aim 2. Enroll in SCOSI-M 112 physicians from 3 environments who currently serve veterans, military members, and their families and who also routinely prescribe Schedule II opioids, and engage them in a 2-visit intervention. Aim 3. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the SCOSI-M intervention. Feasibility relates to reaching targeted physicians and engaging them in SCOSI-M. Effectiveness is measured by physicians registering for and use of the South Carolina Reporting &amp; Identification Prescription Tracking System (SCRIPTS) when prescribing opioids (e.g., % of new patients the physician queried). Secondary outcomes are measures of safer prescribing practices (% of patients prescribed 100 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day), adoption of other prescription management practices (administer alcohol/drug screen, order drug tests). Exploratory outcomes are the association of the intervention with prescription drug misuse or abuse measures for the military population and overall adult population of Richland County, SC. A successful R34 pilot study will inform the design of a future large-scale randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of academic detailing combined with increased PDMP use in reducing prescription drug misuse.

 Previously, we identified the small, Ras-like GTPase Rem2 as a critical regulator of neuronal morphology,
synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the vertebrate nervous system. Rem2 is a member of the RGK
family of non-canonical Ras-like GTPases and is primarily expressed in the brain. Our published studies
demonstrated that Rem2 functions in a CaMK signaling pathway that restricts dendritic branching. In fact,
Rem2 is itself a substrate of CaMKII, and phosphorylation of Rem2 by CaMKII is required for Rem2 to regulate
dendritic branching. CaMKII is an abundant protein kinase that serves many functions in diverse tissues
including regulation of activity-dependent dendritic remodeling, Long Term Potentiation (LTP), which is the
biological correlate of learning and memory, and regulation of hypertrophy and Ca2+ homeostasis in heart
muscle.
 To better understand Rem2 signaling, we took an unbiased, proteomics approach to identify Rem2
interacting proteins and found that Rem2 interacts with all four CaMKII isoforms. Using an in vitro kinase assay
with purified proteins, we demonstrated that Rem2, while a substrate of CaMKII, also potently inhibits its kinase
activity. This suggests that Rem2 is a direct, endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII activity, a previously un-described
function for this protein. While many pathways that activate CaMKII have been identified, there is only one
other molecule described thus far in mammalian cells that inhibits CaMKII signaling (CaMKIIN). Interestingly,
other RGK family members influence CaMKII activity in different cell types, although the exact mechanism of
this regulation has not been reported. We propose experiments that will provide a detailed, mechanistic
understanding of CaMKII inhibition by Rem2 and further, determine if inhibition of CaMKII activity is a
conserved function of the RGK family.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PARADIS, SUZANNE </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21NS101702</grantId><grantName>Modulation of chemosensory behaviors by gut microbiota</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>446018.74</amount><startDate>2017-01-15</startDate><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, Desire for food, Appetite, Bacteria, Behavior, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Cells, Cell Body, Cognition, Communication, Cues, Disease, Disorder, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacteria, Enteric Bacteria, Coliform Bacilli, Environment, Food, Food or Food Product, Future, Genes, Behavioral Genetics, behavior genetics, Genetic Determinants of Behavior, Goals, Health, Human, Modern Man, Intestines, bowel, Intestinal, Maps, Metabolism, Metabolic Processes, Intermediary Metabolism, Study models, Biological Models, Model System, Biologic Models, Moods, Nematoda, roundworm, Nematodes, Nervous system structure, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, nervous system disorder, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, Nervous System Physiology, nervous system function, Neurological function, Neurologic function, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Afferent Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Neuropeptides, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Organism, living system, Physiology, Physiological Processes, Physiologic Processes, Organismal Process, Organism-Level Process, Research, Signal Pathway, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Testing, Work, Experimental Models, Mediating, C.elegans, C. elegans, C elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans, Physiologic, Physiological, Chemicals, insight, Stimulus, Individual, Disease Progression, Metabolic, Genetic, Shapes, Knowledge, Investigation, Complex, Sensory, System, environmental stressor, experience, sensory mechanism, neuroregulation, neuromodulatory, neuromodulation, neural regulation, neural control, microbial, neuronal circuitry, neuronal circuit, neurotransmission, neuronal signaling, neural signaling, nerve signaling, glial signaling, glia signaling, axonal signaling, axon-glial signaling, axon signaling, Neuronal Transmission, Nerve Transmission, Nerve Impulse Transmission, neural circuit, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, Regulation, Property, response, Habitats, behavior influence, behavioral influence, Pathogenicity, Resolution, Molecular, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, innovative, innovate, innovation, Microbe, public health relevance, intestinal tract microflora, intestinal microflora, intestinal microbiota, intestinal microbes, intestinal flora, gut microflora, gut microbiotic, gut microbial consortia, gut microbial composition, gut microbial community, gut microbe community, gut flora, gut community, gut commensal, gastrointestinal microbial flora, enteric microbiota, enteric microbial community, Gastrointestinal microbiota, GI microbiota, gut microbiota, metabolic rate, multispecies consortia, microbial flora, microbial consortia, microbiota, behavioral plasticity, experimental research, experiment, experimental study, commensal bacterial species, commensal bacteria, microbiota-gut-brain signaling, microbiota-gut-brain interactions, microbiota-gut-brain axis, bacteria in the gut, gut bacteria, gut-brain signaling, gut-brain relationship, gut-brain interactions, gut-brain communication, gut to brain axis, gut-brain axis, gut microbial species, gut microbes,</keyword><description>Project Summary / Abstract
 Animals are colonized by diverse bacterial strains that influence multiple aspects of the host's
behavior and physiology. In particular, neuronal functions are now known to be modulated by the
composition of an animal's microbiota. Enteric bacteria greatly influence behavior, mood, cognition, and the
onset and progression of neurological diseases via modulation of neuron and neuronal circuit functions.
However, it remains challenging to provide a mechanistic description of the effects of gut microbiota on
nervous system function in the complex mammalian system.
 The nematode C. elegans is associated with a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic
bacteria in its natural habitat. C. elegans can be grown on monoxenic bacterial cultures, and hosts live
bacterial colonies in its intestine. As in other animals, these gut bacteria have been shown to influence C.
elegans physiology and health. We recently found that cultivation of C. elegans on non-pathogenic bacteria,
and the presence of live gut bacteria, alter C. elegans chemosensory behaviors. The overall goal of this
R21 is to take advantage of the experimental strengths of C. elegans to identify the molecular and neuronal
mechanisms by which enteric bacteria influence sensory neuron function and sensory behaviors.
 The specific goals are to:
1) Analyze the neuronal mechanisms underlying gut microbe-induced behavioral plasticity.
2) Identify host molecular mechanisms that mediate gut bacteria-dependent changes in chemosensory
behaviors.
 Innovative aspects of this work include the establishment of C. elegans as an experimental model
for the study of the gut-brain axis, and analysis of the effects of enteric bacteria on sensory neuron and
neural circuit function at high mechanistic resolution. Given the extensive conservation of many neuronal
and physiological processes, insights from this work are expected to influence our understanding of the
pathways by which commensal bacteria regulate diverse aspects of nervous system function in
development and disease in other organisms.</description><investigator><investigatorId>SENGUPTA, PIALI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21NS096414</grantId><grantName>Genetic tools for visualization of co-transmission in identified neurons</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>446875.0</amount><startDate>2016-09-01</startDate><endDate>2018-12-31</endDate><keyword>Accounting, Antibodies, driving, Automobile Driving, Behavior, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Cell Body, Cells, Color, Communication, Courtship, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, nutrient intake activity, feeding-related behaviors, Ingestive Behavior, Feeding behaviors, γ-Aminobutyric Acid, GABA, Aminalone, Aminalon, 4-amino-butanoic acid, 4-Aminobutyric Acid, 4-Aminobutanoic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Genes, behavior genetics, Genetic Determinants of Behavior, Behavioral Genetics, glutamatergic, L-Glutamate, Glutamates, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Learning, Libraries, Logic, Maps, Memory, Methods, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Peptides, Phenotype, Potassium Channel, Potassium Ion Channels, K channel, Proteins, Reproduction, Role, social role, Sea, Serotonin, Hippophaine, Enteramine, 5HT, 5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Sleep, Spatial Distribution, Synapses, synapse, Synaptic, Synaptic Vesicles, Technology, Tetanus Toxin, Clostridium tetani Toxin, Traction, Generations, Racial Segregation, segregation, Mediating, promotor, promoter, Visualization, Imagery, base, Label, Site, Chemicals, Failure, Individual, Genetic, Vesicle, Reporter, tool, Nature, Complex, Pattern, Techniques, System, visual processing, mutant, protein reconstitution, neurotransmitter release, homologous recombination, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, relating to nervous system, neural, Code, Coding System, Modeling, Protein Fragment, Ectopic Expression, Resolution, in vitro Assay, Pathologic, Transmission, transmission process, Process, Modification, developmental, Development, Behavioral, Output, visualization tool, Visualization software, Population, reconstitution, reconstitute, addiction, addictive disorder, postsynaptic, public health relevance, information model, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR, memory consolidation, intersectionality,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to understand how brains generate behavior both in normal and pathological situations relies on our understanding of the neural computations carried out by behavioral circuits. The nature of chemical communication between neurons is determined by the specific neurotransmitters released onto postsynaptic targets and it was thought for many years that neurons released a single type of transmitter onto all their targets. In recent years, however, it has become clear that key neurons in vertebrate and invertebrate circuits involved in addiction, memory formation, feeding behavior and reproduction contain neurons that violate this rule, releasing multiple neurotransmitters. In this proposal we develop genetic tools to allow mapping of the distribution of specific neurotransmitter release sites in single neurons in multiple colors by modifying the endogenous genetic loci of vesicular transporters for neurotransmitter with fluorescent proteins. This allows both accurate and complete accounting of transmitter release sites since the marker's generation and turnover rely on processes that control the presence of the endogenous protein. Single cell resolution is obtained via an intersectional version of this strategy in which split fluorescent proteins become reconstituted only in specific cells. There is no current technique in any system which can provide this level of resolution. This technology will provide the ability to determine, in complex
neurons releasing several chemical substances, the spatial distribution of each of the chemicals and its relationship to downstream targets of that neuron. It will also allow the mapping of temporal changes, either developmental or plasticity-induced, in neurotransmitter release. The technique is developed initially for use in Drosophila, a model organism which has been immensely important for our understanding of both the genetic and circuit basis of behavior, but as a general strategy can also be adapted for use in mammalian brain.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21HS021891</grantId><grantName>IMPROVING NURSING HOME COMPARE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MINORITY POPULATIONS</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</funderAgency><amount>557092.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-30</startDate><endDate>2015-08-31</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21HD076340</grantId><grantName>The Impact of Parental Military Deployment on Children with Disabilities</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>426900.99</amount><startDate>2014-07-01</startDate><endDate>2017-06-30</endDate><keyword>Afghanistan, Age, Anxiety, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autism, Autistic Disorder, manic depressive illness, manic depressive disorder, bipolar disease, bipolar affective disorder, Manic-Depressive Psychosis, Bipolar Affective Psychosis, Bipolar Disorder, Parturition, Birth, Buffers, youngster, childrens', children, Children (0-21), Child Youth, Child Human, 0-11 years old, Child, Conflict, Conflict (Psychology), Death, Cessation of life, Depressive disorder, Diagnosis, Divorce, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Emergencies, Emergency Situation, Environment, Experimental Designs, Family, Health, Iraq, life course, Life Cycle, Life Cycle Stages, Psychological Health, Mental Hygiene, Mental Health, Mental Hygiene Services, Mental Health Services, Methods, Military, Armed Forces Personnel, Military Personnel, mother child interaction, Mother-Child Relationship, Human Maternal Behavior, Mother-Child Relations, Multivariate Analyses, Multivariate Analysis, pressure, Recommendation, Research, study design, Study Type, Research Design, Risk, Specialty, medical specialties, Stress, Testing, War, Measures, Relative, Relative (related person), health care, Healthcare, Injury, base, Variation, Variant, Family Violence, disability, healthcare utilization, healthcare service utilization, health services utilization, Health Care Utilization, health care service utilization, Handicapped Children, Children with Disabilities, Disabled Children, Pattern, Intellectual limitation, Intellectual disability, Intellectual functioning disability, Visit, Services, experience, stressor, cohesion, member, sleep problem, Sleep Disorders, Modeling, behavioral health, response, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Provider, Health system, Data, Department of Defense, NICHD, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Subgroup, resilience, Outcome, coping, Population, innovative, innovate, innovation, motor impairment, high risk, arm,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Impact of Parental Military Deployment on Children with Disabilities Long wartime assignments put unprecedented pressures on the U.S. Armed Forces and their families. [Although the pace of deployments have been reduced recently, it remains critical to understand the impact of deployment as U.S. Armed Forces are routinely called to conflicts around the globe.] Despite high levels of resilience among military families, they remain at risk for stress-related outcomes and, relative to parental deployment, some research has found that children have experienced increases in visits for depressive disorders, sleep disorders, and anxiety, and greater use of psychotropic medications. Although these findings foreshadow possible greater negative consequences of deployment for children with disabilities who generally utilize more services, this group has not been separately studied. Life course transitions are often major stressors on families of children with disabilities and are
associated with additional negative child outcomes. The proposed R21 study is in response to PA-11-202 [Research on Children in Military Families: The Impact of Parental Military Deployment and Reintegration on Child and Family Functioning] and the Specific Aims are to (1) analyze longitudinal military health system data to describe health care utilization patterns among children of military members with significant disabilities; (2) conduct multivariate difference-in-difference analysis to assess the association of deployment on these utilization patterns; and (3) test whether aspects of the family environment during deployment buffer or exacerbate the effect of deployment on these utilization patterns. The study will focus on children with autism, children with bipolar disorder, children with motor impairments and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities identified by diagnoses contained on healthcare claims. The proposed study is innovative in its approach to understanding the impact of parental deployment. First, we will focus on a carefully defined population of children with significant and
specific types of disabilities. Second, we have access to existing, longitudinal, unusually comprehensive data on each child. Third, we will construct a wide range of discrete health care utilization measures, some of which will reflect routine and preventative services, some reflecting special need services, and others that may be indicative of crisis or emergency needs. Fourth, although by necessity all studies of deployment must be based on observational rather than experimental data, we will utilize a particularly strong, quasi-experimental design based on difference in difference multivariate analysis of pre-post measures of two non-equivalent groups. Finally, we are designing the study and will interpret our results based on a conceptual model that assesses the relation between aspects of the family environment and critical outcomes, a model developed by project team members. The findings will provide necessary information for TRICARE, the health system of the Department of Defense, to evaluate the unique needs of military families of children with significant disabilities and generate specific recommendations regarding needed interventions to support families and children during deployments.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WARFIELD, MARJI ERICKSON</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21DC016706</grantId><grantName>Palatability Coding and Gustatory Cortex</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>485533.42</amount><startDate>2017-12-01</startDate><endDate>2021-11-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Amygdaloid structure, Amygdala, Amygdaloid Body, Amygdaloid Nucleus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, Axon, Behavior, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Bulimia, Bulimia Nervosa, bulimic, Cells, Cell Body, Disease, Disorder, Eating, Food Intake, Eating Disorders, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Feeding behaviors, Ingestive Behavior, feeding-related behaviors, nutrient intake activity, Food, Food or Food Product, Genetic Engineering, Genetic Engineering Biotechnology, Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology, Recombinant DNA Technology, genetically engineered, Goals, Hunger, Hyperphagia, Overeating, polyphagia, Hypothalamic structure, Hypothalamus, hypothalamic, Lead, Pb element, heavy metal Pb, heavy metal lead, Learning, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, nutrition, Obesity, adiposity, corpulence, corpulency, corpulentia, obese, obese people, obese person, obese population, Legal patent, Patents, Pharmacology, Play, Production, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Research, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Taste Perception, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Testing, Thirst, United States, Work, Mediating, base, Lateral, Area, Physiologic, Physiological, Training, Malaise, Ingestion, insight, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, Nature, compulsive eating, compulsive feeding, compulsive overeating, Binge Eating, Investigation, Complex, gastrointestinal, experience, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, neuroregulation, cholinergic, neural, relating to nervous system, Familiarity, Structure, novel, Preventative strategy, Preventive strategy, Prevention strategy, Palate, social, Coding System, Code, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Modeling, craving, driving behavior, Property, response, theories, Hydration, Hydration status, Preventative intervention, Prevention intervention, preventional intervention strategy, Preventive Intervention, Process, Behavioral, pathway, Pathway interactions, cholinergic neuron, orofacial, Population, Consumption, hedonic, treatment strategy, effective treatment, effective therapy, optogenetics, Conditioned Taste Aversion, Taste aversion, taste stimuli, gustatory system, taste system, experiment, experimental research, experimental study,</keyword><description>Abstract
The current proposal takes a circuit-based approach to investigate how the gustatory cortex (GC) processes the
hedonic value (or palatability) of a food in cooperation with the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral
hypothalamus (LH). This complex circuit approach is taken because the control of ingestion is a complicated
process: while physiological needs (e.g., hunger, thirst) exert an important force on consumption, the hedonic
value of a taste plays a powerful, potentially competing role; in fact, we often eat or drink not to satisfy
physiological needs but to fulfill the desire to consume palatable food—a desire that, in extreme cases, may
eventually lead to disorders such as binge eating and bulimia nervosa, severe social issues that affect millions
of people a year in the United States. Our work has established that GC, the cortical projection of the central
gustatory system, plays a pivotal role in processing the hedonic value of a taste stimulus: GC taste responses
show 2 temporally separated firing epochs, the first representing taste identity (here, Epoch 1) and the second
epoch reflecting the hedonic value conveyed by the taste (Epoch 2); furthermore, this activity not only reflects
palatability but plays a role in causing it—the onset of Epoch 2 predicts the timing of taste-evoked orofacial
responses, and inhibition of GC significantly perturbs production of those responses. The current work will extend
these findings by exploring the rich reciprocal connections between GC and BLA and LH, subcortical areas in
which taste responses also show epoch-like firing activity. I hypothesize that palatability-related firing in GC
requires inputs from BLA and/or LH. To test this hypothesis, I will directly examine how optogenetic silencing of
projections from BLA and/or LH influence GC taste responses (Aim 1) and learning-related changes in
palatability (Aim 2, conditioned taste aversion or CTA). Finally, in Aim 3, with the use of a genetically engineered
rat model (ChAT::cre+ rats), I will evaluate the influence of cholinergic signaling perturbation on naïve and
learning-related palatability behavior and attendant neural responses, thus deepening my search for specific
pathways responsible for the processing of palatability. Together, this research project will enrich our
understanding of neural control of palatability-mediated consumption, based on which we may identify more
effective treatment and prevention strategies for eating disorders.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LIN, JIAN-YOU </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21DC013416</grantId><grantName>Regeneration and regrowth of sensory cilia via non-canonical mechanisms</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>444772.0</amount><startDate>2013-07-01</startDate><endDate>2016-06-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Age, Aging, Animals, anosphrasia, Anosmia, Subcellular Process, Cellular Process, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Function, Cell Process, Cell Function, Cell physiology, Cells, Chlamydomonas, Cilia, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, Exhibits, Future, Genes, Goals, Inner Hair Cells, sound perception, hearing perception, Hearing, Hedgehogs, Erinaceidae, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, Housing, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Kinetics, inner ear, Internal Ear, Labyrinth, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Photoradiation, Light, Maintenance, Micro-tubule, Microtubules, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, Organelles, living system, Organism, Visual Receptor, Photosensitive Cell, Photoreceptor Cell, Photoreceptors, gene product, Proteins, regenerate, Regeneration, Natural regeneration, Visual Purple, Rhodopsin, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, vertebrata, Vertebrate Animals, Vertebrates, Work, Generations, Guanine Nucleotide Regulatory Proteins, Guanine Nucleotide Coupling Protein, GTP-Regulatory Proteins, G-Proteins, GTP-Binding Proteins, Mediating, C.elegans, C elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans, base, Peripheral, Olfactory Receptor Neurons, Chemicals, Stereovillus, Stereocilium, insight, Stimulus, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Functional disorder, gene function, Morphology, Knowledge, Sensory, cell type, Pattern, mutant, model organism, Animal Models and Related Studies, Animal Model, trafficking, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Structure, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, olfactory receptor, Bypass, neurogenesis, Central Nervous System, CNS Nervous System, Neuraxis, ciliogenesis, cilium biogenesis, Kinocilium, Ciliary Process, Structure of ciliary processes, Signaling Protein, Defect, Motor, in vivo, Cilium Microtubule, Signaling Molecule, Molecular Transport, Transport Process, Process, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, designing, design, aged, morphogens, public health relevance, ciliopathy,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory organelles that are now known to be present on nearly all cell types in humans and other metazoans. Cilia house signaling molecules and are required to accurately sense and transduce environmental stimuli. Cilia are particularly critical for the sensory functions of peripheral chem-, mechano- and photo-sensory neurons. For instance, olfactory signaling proteins are concentrated in the cilia that emanate from the dendritic knob of olfactory sensory neurons. Disruption of olfactory cilia results in anosmia. Similarly, loss of kinocilia in the inner ear reslts in defects in the organization of the stereocilia bundle leading to hearing anomalies. Ciliary dysfunction underlies a range of disorders and diseases collectively referred to as ciliopathies.  Ciliogenic mechanisms are highly conserved across species, and insights from model organisms such as C. elegans and Chlamydomonas have been instrumental in defining molecules and mechanisms required for cilia structure and function. A subset of sensory neurons in C. elegans is ciliated and as in their vertebrate counterparts, these cilia contain signaling molecules and are essential for sensory transduction. All cilia are formed by the highly conserved process of intraflagellar transport or IFT; loss of IFT gene function results in severe ciliary structural defects. We made the surprising observation that cilia-like processes regenerate and regrow upon aging in a subset of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans lacking IFT gene function. These processes resemble bona fide cilia since they house ciliary proteins and partly restore chemosensory functions to the sensory neurons. We hypothesize that aging induces ciliary regrowth or regeneration via partly non- canonical ciliogenic mechanisms in C. elegans. The overall goal of this exploratory R21 proposal is to further investigate the mechanisms of this previously undescribed regeneration process. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Describe the structure and function of regenerated cilia-like structures in IFT mutants. Experiments proposed in this aim will investigate the extent to which the structure and function of the regenerated cilia-like structures in aged IFT mutants resemble those of cilia present in age-matched wild-type animals. 2) Investigate the mechanisms required for regrowth of cilia-like structures in aged IFT mutants. Experiments proposed in this aim will investigate the mechanisms by which regrowth of the cilia-like structures is triggered in aging animals, as well as identify the molecules and pathways which mediate the regrowth.  Results from this work will provide the framework for the design of future experiments aimed at further characterizing this previously undescribed phenomenon of age-regulated ciliary regrowth in the absence of core IFT gene function. Since ciliogenic mechanisms are remarkably conserved across phyla, we expect that our findings will have major implications on our knowledge of cilia generation and maintenance, and may suggest new avenues and strategies to target ciliopathies and sensory neuron dysfunction.

provided funding to each state to ramp up the range of responses in hopes of reversing the ongoing opioid
crisis. Pharmacotherapy to address opioid use disorders (OUDs) is an evidence-based practice although it is
clearly underutilized, especially by primary care providers. Washington State is implementing a “Hub &amp; Spoke”
(H&amp;S) integrated care model to expand access to pharmacotherapy services (also known as medication-
assisted treatment or MAT) and reduce unmet need for people with OUDs regardless of how or where clients
enter the treatment system. This proposed R21/R33 study will take a hybrid effectiveness-implementation
approach, with both implementation evaluation and effectiveness as primary goals. It is essential to understand
how the H&amp;S model is implemented to understand if, how, and why it is an effective approach to treat OUDs.
 The specific aims for the proposed study are as follows. R21 PHASE – Early Implementation and
Feasibility: (1) Confirm the feasibility of collecting client and program data from hubs, spokes and comparison
groups; collect baseline data; and confirm data linkages with other key databases; (2) Finalize elements
needed for R33 effectiveness study, including comparison groups, dependent variables, and key analytic
subgroups; (3) Assess the early implementation of the H&amp;S model. R33 PHASE – Effectiveness: (1) Test
whether the H&amp;S model is effective for addressing OUDs; (2) Determine whether people with OUDs treated in
the H&amp;S model have better outcomes if they receive pharmacotherapy + counseling versus only
pharmacotherapy. (3) Test whether the H&amp;S model is differentially effective for subgroups (e.g., age, gender,
OUD type, mental disorder, rural); (4) Examine, using mixed methods, implementation of the H&amp;S model and
how specific aspects across and within each hub-spoke network relate to the overall effectiveness.
 This study will focus primarily on adults (18+) with OUDs in Washington who are enrolled in Medicaid,
about 90% of people with OUDs in treatment in Washington. Effectiveness measure include a range of
structure, outcome and process measures at client- and system-levels, including drug use, overdose, access
to pharmacotherapy, and arrests, incarceration and employment. Washington is a leader in addiction treatment
services and detailed, linkable data systems. Statistical methods will be used to ensure a rigorous quasi-
experimental design. The findings from this study will enable us to understand the essential elements of the
H&amp;S model for the most effective treatment for OUDs, and how to bring more primary care providers to the
addiction pharmacotherapy practice. It will serve as a model for other states and systems, offering a flexible
approach that addresses many existing barriers to the use of pharmacotherapy for people with OUDs, ensuring
that there is no wrong door to enter treatment and that people with OUDs receive the treatment with the best
success for promoting recovery.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21DA032039</grantId><grantName>Enhancing Early-Phase Care for Primary Care Patients with Unhealthy Substance Use</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>396931.0</amount><startDate>2012-04-01</startDate><endDate>2016-03-31</endDate><keyword>etoh use, ethanol use, ethanol product use, ethanol intake, ethanol ingestion, ethanol drinking, ethanol consumption, alcoholic drink intake, alcoholic beverage consumption, alcohol use, alcohol product use, alcohol intake, alcohol ingestion, alcohol consumed, EtOH drinking, Alcohol Drinking, Alcohol consumption, Control Groups, Counseling, Diagnosis, Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical, Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical, Drug Screening, Preclinical Drug Evaluation, Environment, facial, faces, Face, Patient Care Delivery, Patient Care, Health, inducement, Incentives, indexing, Interview, Photoradiation, Light, Massachusetts, Motivation, Out-patients, Outpatients, Patient Participation, Patients, pilot study, Pilot Projects, Play, Primary Healthcare, Primary Care, Primary Health Care, Probability, Research, Risk, social role, Role, Specialty, medical specialties, Substance Use Disorder, Survey Instrument, Surveys, Testing, Time, Veterans, Measures, Prize, health care, Healthcare, Caring, base, health administration, improved, Area, Phase, Medical, Link, Training, insight, using substances, substance use, AOD use, Alcohol or Other Drugs use, drug use, Drug usage, Integrated Delivery Systems, Adopted, Complex, Pattern, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Visit, Services, Medical center, experience, Performance, cohort, skills, novel, contingency management, QOC, Quality of Care, response, stigma, social stigma, Gifts, Provider, Address, Health system, Data, randomly assigned, randomization, randomisation, Randomized, Patterns of Care, Screening Result, Monitor, Process, followed up, follow up, Active Follow-up, follow-up, Electronic Health Record, designing, design, Outcome, innovative, innovate, innovation, early therapy, Early treatment, primary care setting, alcohol screening, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment, SBIRT, screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment, financial incentive, screening,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary care settings offer an excellent opportunity to identify and address unhealthy substance use ranging from at-risk use to substance use disorders (SUD). Practitioners can help with problem identification, brief counseling, follow-up/monitoring, motivating patients, and linkage to specialty care. However, opportunities are often missed. Even when SUD are identified, there are low rates of treatment initiation (1 SUD service in any setting within 14 days after diagnosis) and engagement (2 services in 30 days after initiation) as defined in the widely-used HEDIS performance measures. Both patients and providers play a role. For example, providers may lack skills, time or motivation; patients may face stigma, denial or access barriers. The Veterans Health Administration (VA), like other systems, faces a challenge in this area. About 7% of all veterans and up to 25% of younger cohorts have SUD. Many more have at-risk use. Among VA patients identified with SUD in an outpatient medical (non-behavioral health) setting only 9% initiate care, and 31% of those engage in care. Yet these are recognized as important parameters of early-phase care and engagement has been linked to better outcomes. The aims of this exploratory study in a large VA medical center are to: 1) Examine screening patterns and early care trajectories including provider response and service use following a) positive drug or alcohol screening in primary care, and b) SUD diagnosis; identify associated patient and provider factors. 2) Conduct pilot testing of patient incentives to enhance treatment initiation and engagement for primary care patients identified with SUD in primary care. 3) Assess patient and provider perspectives on early-phase care and treatment incentives. The study environment includes electronic health records, SBIRT training, and a brief drug screen added to well-adopted annual alcohol screening. In Aim 1, we analyze screening patterns and early care trajectories. In Aim 2, we pilot test contingency management-based incentives for early treatment participation for primary care patients with SUD (n=120 patients randomly assigned to incentives or control). We examine utilization and substance use outcomes. "Prize-based" financial incentives feature higher probability for low-value prizes. In Aim 3, we interview patients and providers on screening, early-phase care challenges, and incentives. This innovative study will shed light on early care patterns for patients identified in primary care with unhealthy substance use, making a unique contribution through analysis of linked screening, provider response and utilization data. It will yield preliminary evidence on how patient incentives may enhance treatment participation (untested in primary care). It will tap patient and provider views on early-phase car and incentives. Results will inform efforts to improve care as well as design of full-scale trials (e.g. comparing different levels of incentives). Thus, the study represents a novel line of research with far-reaching potential to improve quality of care.

become one of the most pressing global healthcare problems in modern society. There is an urgent need for
novel antimicrobial agents against multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Because the major cause of resistance
is beta-lactamase (a bacteria-specific enzyme) to degrade antibiotics, the proposed work will turn the cause of
resistance to the event of killing the bacteria. That is, this research will develop the precursors that are
responsive to beta-lactamase for in-situ (i.e., on the surface of bacteria) formation of nanoscale assemblies
that kill MDR bacteria. The goal of this work is to explore enzyme-instructed self-assembly—that is, the
integration of enzymatic catalysis and molecular self-assembly—as a paradigm-shifting approach for the
discovery and early development of novel therapies for treating infections caused by drug resistant bacteria.
This proposal is both hypothesis and design driven. We hypothesize that enzyme-instructed self-assembly, as
a unique way to localize the nanoscale assemblies of cationic peptides onto bacteria, will kill MDR bacteria.
Our past results—beta-lactamase instructing self-assembly of peptides, self-assembled nanofibers of ultrashort
cationic peptides inhibiting biofilms, enzyme-instructed self-assembly inhibiting bacterial growth, and
multivalent antibiotics inhibiting MDR bacteria—strongly support the hypothesis. To validate the hypothesis, we
will design cationic peptides that self-assemble upon the action of beta-lactamase, characterize the
physiochemical properties of the peptides and their assemblies, and assess the antibacterial activities of the
nanoscale assemblies against MDR bacteria. Specifically, we will evaluate 1) the effects of charge balance of
the precursors, 2) the effects of side chain length of the cationic peptides, and 3) the effects of peptide
sequence of the cationic peptides on the nanoscale assemblies of cationic peptides for killing MDR bacteria.
By designing, synthesizing, and characterizing the β-lactam containing precursors of cationic peptides and
evaluate the antibacterial activities of the corresponding assemblies of the cationic peptides against MDR
bacteria, we anticipate that this research will improve fundamental understanding of antimicrobial therapy,
provide guiding principles to design antibacterial agents, and ultimately lead to an unprecedented approach of
antibacterial drug development that integrates enzymatic reactions and molecular self-assembly.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, BING </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R21AG054724</grantId><grantName>The Role of the FOXO Pathway in the Control of Transposons in Aging</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>446427.97</amount><startDate>2016-12-08</startDate><endDate>2019-11-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Age, ages, Aging, Algorithms, Animals, Attention, Automobile Driving, driving, Biology, Malignant Neoplasms, neoplasm/cancer, malignancy, Malignant Tumor, Cancers, Cardiovascular Diseases, cardiovascular disorder, Cell Count, Cell Number, Cell Culture Techniques, cell culture, Cells, Cell Body, Complement, Complement Proteins, Drosophila genus, fruit fly, Drosophila, Family, Genes, Goals, Human, Modern Man, Natural Immunity, Nonspecific Immunity, Non-Specific Immunity, Native Immunity, Innate Immunity, Insulin, Regular Insulin, Novolin R, Humulin R, Invertebrates, Invertebrata, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Longevity, lifespan, life span, Length of Life, Maintenance, Mammals, Mammalia, Medicine, Biological Models, Model System, Biologic Models, Modernization, mortality, Mus, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Nerve Degeneration, neuronal degeneration, neurological degeneration, neurodegenerative, neurodegeneration, neural degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, Phenotype, RNA Viruses, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Specificity, Stroke, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral vascular accident, brain attack, Cerebrovascular Stroke, Cerebrovascular Apoplexy, Cerebral Stroke, Brain Vascular Accident, Apoplexy, Testing, Time, Tissues, Body Tissues, transcription factor, Transcription factor genes, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, General Transcription Factors, General Transcription Factor Gene, Basal transcription factor genes, Basal Transcription Factor, Genetic Transcription, Transcription, RNA Expression, Gene Transcription, Generations, Measures, C.elegans, C. elegans, C elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans, Area, Acute, Physiologic, Physiological, Regulon, Stimulus, Sample Size, Metabolic, tool, Protocols documentation, Protocol, System, viral resistance, virus resistance, Viral, cohort, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, Prevention, Somatic Cell, Regulation, Modeling, response, Small Interfering RNA, siRNA, Short interfering RNA, RNA Interference, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNAi, RNA Silencing, Quelling, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, Tissue Sample, FOXO1A gene, Forkhead in Rhabdomyosarcoma, Forkhead Box O1A, FOXO1A, FOXO1, FKHR, FOXO3A gene, Forkhead in Rhabdomyosarcoma-Like 1, Forkhead Box O3A, FOXO3A, FOXO3, FKHRL1, FKHR-Like 1, MLLT7 gene, MLLT7, FOXO4, AFX1, Small RNA, Aging-Related Process, Aging Process, Human Pathology, Insulin Signaling Pathway, Molecular Target, Molecular, Process, sex, Flies, fly, pathway, Pathway interactions, age dependent, age related, aging effect, age effect, insertion/deletion, insertion-deletion mutation, insertion-deletion, indel, insertion/deletion mutation, Population, overexpress, over-expression, overexpression, RNAseq, RNA sequencing, RNA Seq, transcriptome sequencing, genomic integrity, genome integrity, integration site, experimental research, experiment, experimental study,</keyword><description>The Role of the FOXO Pathway in the Control of Transposons in Aging
 Understanding aging and the processes that effect lifespan at the molecular level remains an important
problem in modern biology and medicine. The Forkhead-box, family O (FOXO) transcription factors have been
identified as factors that can extend lifespan and stave off aging in a number of model systems including
worms, flies and mice. In general, increasing FOXO activity increases lifespan in these models. FOXO activity
can be increased by overexpressing FOXO or by downregulating the insulin signaling pathway, a major
negative regulator of FOXO. Complementing the findings in model organisms, SNPs associated with longevity
in humans have been identified in the FOXO1, FOXO3 and components of the insulin signaling pathway in
multiple cohorts. This strongly suggests that the FOXO pathway influences lifespan in humans as well.
Therefore, an important goal is to identify the molecular targets and pathways controlled by FOXO transcription
factors to better understand the multiple mechanisms that influence aging. Mammals have four FOXO genes
(FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6) with some division of labor between the four factors often complicating
interpretation of experiments. Invertebrates each have a single FOXO gene, daf-16 in C. elegans and foxo in
Drosophila. Given the conserved role in affecting lifespan, the simple invertebrate system offers a powerful tool
to understand the FOXO regulon in molecular detail.
 FOXO factors are typically regulated as downstream components of insulin and insulin-like factor
signaling. Because of this, much attention has been paid to the role of FOXO on metabolic influences driving
aging. However, there are certainly other drivers of aging in addition to the metabolic. One area that is
underexplored is FOXO's role in the maintenance of genome integrity as factor increasing longevity.
 Genome integrity decreases with age and it has been argued that this may be a driver of ageing
phenotypes in somatic cells. While genome integrity is controlled by multiple mechanisms there is a growing
appreciation that transposon activation occurs as a function of age and may be a driver of genome integrity
loss. This age related transposon activation has been observed in both Drosophila and mammals. In
Drosophila transposon mobilization has been shown to lead to neurodegeneration and increase mortality.
 We recently identified the small RNA pathways as downstream direct targets of foxo in Drosophila. We
also identified a physiological role for this control in viral innate immunity through the siRNA pathway.
Increasing foxo activity led to an increase in the efficacy of the RNAi response. This effect both increased post-
transcriptional silencing of endogenous loci and led to viral clearance in infected cells. This is the first pathway
identified that can modulate RNA interference in somatic cells. Although viral resistance could be one of the
ways foxo enhances lifespan this would require an acute encounter with an RNA virus and would not be a
generalizable effect. However, the siRNA pathway is also known to control transposons in somatic cells. This
role could potentially provide a broader effect on lifespan as transposon mobilization has been identified as
increasing with age, and has been shown to be a potential cause of shortened lifespan.
 We are seeking to extend these findings in a new direction. We hypothesize that foxo regulates the

Very few cases have been documented in which vaccine-elicited antibodies can bind to the
Man1(alpha)-2Man1(alpha)-2Man “tips” of Man8/9 high-mannose glycans that are prevalent on the HIV
envelope protein. Rather, there is evidence that in most cases, vaccination with Man8/9 structures elicits
antibodies that bind to the “core” of the glycan, and pharmacokinetic literature data show that Man9
structures are rapidly trimmed to Man5/6 structures in vivo, on a timescale that may interfere with
development of antibodies specific for Man9. The goal of this project is to test whether sustained
immunogen delivery methods can increase the elicitation of antibodies specific for the intact Man8/9
glycans, by making intact glycan continuously available to the immune system.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R03AA023390</grantId><grantName>Understanding Disparities in the Treatment of Alcohol and Other Drug Disorders</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>159854.0</amount><startDate>2014-09-15</startDate><endDate>2017-08-31</endDate><keyword>post treatment, After-Treatment, After Care, Aftercare, Censuses, Client, Communities, Disadvantaged, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Employment, Ethnic group, Health, health care service, Health Services, healthcare service availability, healthcare service access, healthcare access availability, health services availability, health care service availability, health care service access, health care availability, care access, availability of services, access to treatment, access to services, access to health services, Availability of Health Services, Accessibility of health care, Access to Healthcare, Access to Health Care, Access to Care, Health Services Accessibility, Information Technology Systems, IT Systems, Data Systems, Information Systems, Literature, Ethnic and Racial Minorities, Minority Groups, Mortality, Mortality Vital Statistics, Out-patients, Outpatients, Overdose, Patients, Public Sector, Racial Stocks, Racial Group, Race, Research, Specialty, medical specialties, Testing, United States, Washington, Racial Segregation, segregation, Treatment outcome, black American, Black or African American, Black Populations, Afroamerican, Afro American, African American, problem drinking, problem alcohol use, hazardous alcohol use, ethanol abuse, alcohol problem, Alcohol abuse, Criminal Justice, Latino, Mediating, Outcome Measure, socioeconomic position, socio-economic position, Socio-economic status, Socioeconomic Status, Caring, Medical, Link, infantile, infancy, Individual, Funding, Ethnicity, Ethnic Origin, Ethnicity aspects, Native Americans, Life, Source, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Quality Indicator, Outcome Study, meetings, experience, Performance, member, ethanol availability, ethanol accessibility, alcohol accessibility, alcohol access, access to alcohol, alcohol availability, Coding System, Code, driving under influence, QOC, Quality of Care, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Data, Characteristics, Process, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, Minority, alcohol and other drug, Outcome, racial/ethnic, racial and ethnic, racial and ethnic disparities,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders have disproportionate impact on the health of minority groups, including more severe alcohol problems and higher rates of drug overdose mortality. Yet, members of racial/ethnic minority groups who need treatment are less likely to access treatment, and once entering treatment are less likely to become engaged in or complete treatment, and to have worse employment and criminal justice treatment outcomes than their white counterparts. Individual factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) have been shown to contribute, but not completely explain racial/ethnic disparities in treatment. One promising direction is to add a focus on community characteristics which have been shown to influence disparities broadly in health and general health care services. The proposed research examines the influence of community characteristics on racial/ethnic disparities in the treatment of AOD disorders. This study will be a secondary analysis using data from Washington's publicly funded specialty AOD treatment system linked to data from state employment and criminal justice agencies, as well as community level data from the U.S. Census, to understand drivers of disparities. The proposed analysis will test to what degree race/ethnicity and community characteristics influence receiving AOD care that conforms to a well-established quality indicator, engagement in outpatient treatment, as well as employment and arrest outcomes. The current study aims to: 1. Determine whether community characteristics mediate racial/ethnic disparities in treatment engagement. 2. Test whether racial/ethnic disparities in post-treatment employment, DUI arrests, and drug-related arrests exist and whether community characteristics mediate any disparities. 3. Explore whether community characteristics' moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity and treatment engagement, employment, and criminal justice outcomes this study has the potential to explain the pathways of how racial/ethnic disparities in AOD treatment occur. Findings from this study will inform the development of appropriate interventions, at the client or community- level, needed to eliminate disparities in AOD treatment, and ultimately in health outcomes.</description><investigator><investigatorId>ACEVEDO, ANDREA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS104818</grantId><grantName>A hierarchy of timescales for switching between states of neural activity during consumption decisions</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1606525.0</amount><startDate>2017-12-15</startDate><endDate>2023-11-30</endDate><keyword>Animals, Attention, Automobile Driving, driving, Behavior, Animal Behavior, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Choice Behavior, Complement, Complement Proteins, Computer Simulation, Computer based Simulation, computational simulation, computerized simulation, Decision Analysis, Decision Making, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Food, Food or Food Product, Learning, Motor Neurons, Motor Cell, motoneuron, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurons, adiposity, corpulence, Obesity, Perception, Research, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Schizophrenia, statistics, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Taste Perception, Taste Disorders, Testing, Time, Work, base, improved, Site, Area, Clinical, Variant, Variation, Training, pediatric, Childhood, insight, Stimulus, Visual, Individual, Dysfunction, Physiopathology, pathophysiology, Functional disorder, Nature, Investigation, Msec, millisecond, Sensory, Source, Techniques, behavior change, parallel processing, Performance, neural, relating to nervous system, expectation, novel, Modality, Palate, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, neural circuit, Modeling, Sampling, Property, response, executive function, executive control, Address, Data, in vivo, Update, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, Output, feeding, Behavioral Assay, Consumption, hedonic, Coupled, chemotherapy, addiction, addictive disorder, optogenetics, behavioral response, behavior response, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>The investigators will combine experimental studies with computational simulations to uncover
the neural circuit mechanisms underlying taste choice behavior. A fundamental question to be
addressed is how the neural activity induced by a given taste is impacted by the recent
sampling of another taste and/or by the expectation that another taste is forthcoming. We will
analyse data produced from ensemble recordings of neural activity and make use of
optogenetic techniques that alter neural activity, to further our work on how specific features of
such activity impact behavior during a decision making task. These data will provide fuel to our
modeling efforts, with which we will produce a framework that can generalize to other sensory
modalities, whenever decisions are based on a consideration of one stimulus at a time (even if
two stimuli are present) rather than on a parallel processing of two or more stimuli
simultaneously—that is, this novel framework will allow us to understand the behavior of
animals when faced with a choice between any two separate stimuli.
Thus, a transformative aspect of the research will be the development of a new framework for
the analysis of decision-making when the choice to be made is whether to stick with the current
stimulus or to switch to another. In such decision making tasks, which are ubiquitous in natural
settings, the stimulus itself is chosen by the subject rather than being controled by the
experimenter. Our recordings of the animal's behavior simultaneously with its neural activity
allow us to tightly constrain these first dynamic models of such a process.
Taste is an important, albeit underused, modality for addressing issues of sensory processing,
in that it has a strong connection to behavior—indeed it is well-nigh impossible for an animal to
sample a taste without a behavioral response. Moreover, given that tastants can be intrinisically
hedonic or aversive, animals are internally driven to make responses and will do so without the
months of training—which inevitably rewires the brain—required for animal training in behavioral
tasks based on other sensory modalities. Therefore taste is ideally suited to the study of
naturalistic decision making.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MILLER, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS103967</grantId><grantName>Diversity Supplement (Monica Quinones-Frias): Roles of Recycling Endosomes in Neuronal Extracellular Vesicle Cargo Traffic</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2829259.0</amount><startDate>2017-12-01</startDate><endDate>2025-05-01</endDate><keyword>AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, Biological Chemistry, Biochemistry, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Cytoplasmic Membrane, Plasma Membrane, plasmalemma, Cell membrane, Clathrin, Communication, Disease, Disorder, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Endocytosis, Foundations, Goals, Human, Modern Man, Microscopy, Morphogenesis, morphogenetic process, Nervous System, Neurologic Body System, Neurologic Organ System, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Nervous System Physiology, Neurologic function, Neurological function, nervous system function, Synaptic Transmission, Neural Transmission, Neuroglia, Glia, Glial Cells, Kolliker's reticulum, Neuroglial Cells, Non-neuronal cell, Nonneuronal cell, nerve cement, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Parkinson Disease, Parkinson, Primary Parkinsonism, Paralysis Agitans, Play, Proteins, Quinones, Quinone Compound, Endosomes, Receptosomes, Research, Role, social role, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Synaptic Membranes, Testing, Mediating, Axon Terminals, Presynaptic Nerve Endings, Synaptic Boutons, Synaptic Terminals, Presynaptic Terminals, Link, Chemicals, insight, Recycling, Therapeutic, Genetic, Morphology, Vesicle, tool, Nature, Knowledge, Complex, Route, cell type, Membrane, membrane structure, retrograde transport, trafficking, novel, Sorting, Regulation, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Membrane Protein Traffic, Membrane Traffic, Resolution, resolutions, in vivo, Cellular Membrane, Process, vesicular release, vesicle release, live cell imaging, live cell image, live cellular image, live cellular imaging, extracellular vesicles, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments,</keyword><description>The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the
packaging and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small
membrane-bound vesicles released by numerous cell types including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for
signaling and disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and
temporally regulated within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to
track and manipulate EV traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of
cargoes through a plasma membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted
for packaging and release in EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling
endosomes have primarily been studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime,
functions, or dynamics at presynaptic terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in
signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and
therapeutically intervening in these important processes will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms
of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV
cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics,
biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging. 1) We will determine the functions,
dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling endosomes. To this end, we will develop
new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct recycling compartments at synapses.
Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how membrane traffic machinery sorts
cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV cargo traffic depends on distinct
modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates under low neuronal activity
and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal activity. These
experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how recycling
endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal traffic,
and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings and
tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>RODAL, AVITAL ADAH</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS103168</grantId><grantName>Role of CaMKII in memory storage</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1766954.0</amount><startDate>2017-08-01</startDate><endDate>2023-05-31</endDate><keyword>Aging, Alzheimer's Disease, AD dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease dementia, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Animals, inhibitor/antagonist, inhibitor, Cell Death, necrocytosis, Cytoplasm, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptiform, epileptogenic, Goals, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, In Vitro, Learning, Maintenance, Memory, Methods, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, nervous system disorder, Nervous System Diseases, Neurologic Disorders, Neurological Disorders, neurological disease, Synaptic Transmission, Neural Transmission, Pathologic Processes, Pathological Processes, Peptides, Phosphotransferases, Kinases, Phosphotransferase Gene, Transphosphorylases, Protein Synthesis Inhibitors, Protein Synthesis Antagonists, Proteins, Role, social role, Specificity, Vertebral column, Spinal Column, Spine, backbone, Stroke, Apoplexy, Brain Vascular Accident, Cerebral Stroke, Cerebrovascular Apoplexy, Cerebrovascular Stroke, brain attack, cerebral vascular accident, cerebrovascular accident, Synapses, Synaptic, synapse, Testing, Weight, Work, N-Methylaspartate, N Methyl D aspartic Acid, N methyl D aspartate, N-Methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA, Healthcare, health care, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, BDNF, enhancing factor, base, Binding Proteins, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CaM KII, CaM PK II, CaM kinase II, CaMKII, calcium-dependent CaM kinase II, Nature, Hour, Complex, Reaction, Viral, densin-180, FRET, Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, memory processing, memory process, novel, memory decline, Memory Loss, neurological dysfunction, Neurologic Dysfunctions, Property, Molecular Interaction, Binding, preventing, prevent, Antimorphic mutation, Dominant Negative, Dominant-Negative Mutant, Dominant-Negative Mutation, in vivo, Optical Methods, Molecular, Process, Modification, Development, developmental, Behavioral, painful neuropathy, neuropathic pain, Synaptic plasticity, addiction, addictive disorder, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Activity-dependent synaptic modifications (LTP/LTD) are a major candidate for the mechanism of memory. LTP
involves induction, maintenance, and expression processes. This proposal seeks to elucidate the molecular
basis of the maintenance process, the process that underlies the engram. The critical test of any hypothesis
regarding maintenance is the “erasure test” in which an inhibitor is applied after LTP/memory is established. If
this blocks LTP/memory and the effect persists after the inhibitor is removed, the inhibitor must have erased a
maintenance process. We have conducted the erasure test using an inhibitor of CaMKII (CN-peptide). We
found that application of this peptide after LTP induction produced erasure of saturated LTP. We now propose
two experiments that test the role of CaMKIIα in memory maintenance at the behavioral level. In the first, we
ask whether a dominant-negative form of CaMKIIα can erase conditioned place avoidance. We present strong
preliminary evidence that it does. The second test is the “occlusion test.” It has been shown that activated
kinase (CaMKIIα*) enhances synaptic transmission that occludes synaptically induced LTP. We will virally
express CaMKIIα* and test two predictions: that because this maximally increases all synaptic weights it
should destroy memory function, and furthermore, that learning under these conditions should not be possible.
Preliminary evidence supporting these predictions is presented. Other experiments in this proposal are aimed
at understanding the nature of the CaMKIIα complex that stores the engram. There are strong reasons to
suspect that what maintains LTP is actually the complex of CaMKIIα with NMDAR (and perhaps also densin-
180). Studies of the binding of proteins to CaMKII have relied on in vitro work, and there has been no previous
method for studying the complexes formed during actual LTP induction. Thus, crucial information regarding the
complex formation and persistence is lacking. We have developed and validated a novel optical method based
on FLIM-FRET. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates that LTP induction produces complex of CaMKIIα with
GluN2B in spines and that the formation is synapse specific. We will determine the duration of the complex
under conditions that either induce short-lasting LTP (early LTP) or produce both early and late LTP. We will
also examine how the duration of the complex depends on factors that enhance (e.g., BDNF) or prevent (e.g.,
protein synthesis inhibitors) late LTP. This approach will be extended to study the interaction of CaMKIIα with
densin-180. Having identified properties of the complex that underlies LTP, in vivo experiments will be
conducted to test whether disruption of protein interactions within the complex can disrupt maintenance of the
engram.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS081013</grantId><grantName>Temperature Compensation of Neuronal and Network Function</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1548145.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-01</startDate><endDate>2016-06-30</endDate><keyword>Animals, Behavior, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Brain Disorders, Brain Diseases, neoplasm/cancer, malignancy, Malignant Tumor, Cancers, Malignant Neoplasms, Subcellular Process, Cellular Process, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Function, Cell Process, Cell Function, Cell physiology, virtual simulation, in silico, computerized simulation, computerized modeling, computer based models, computational simulation, computational models, computational modeling, Mathematical Models and Simulations, Mathematical Model Simulation, Computerized Models, Computer based Simulation, Computer Models, Computer Simulation, Pyrexial Seizure, Pyrexial Convulsion, Fever Seizure, Fever Convulsion, Febrile Seizures, Febrile Fit, Febrile Convulsion Seizure, Febrile Convulsions, True Crabs, Short-Tailed Crabs, Brachyura, Crabs, Crustacean, Crustacea, Family, Neural Ganglion, Ganglia, Goals, Modern Man, Human, Life Experience, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, nervous system function, Neurological function, Neurologic function, Nervous System Physiology, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Neurosciences, social role, Role, Seizures, Stereotyping, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Temperature, Testing, Theoretical Studies, Time, Work, Measures, base, Variation, Variant, Biological, Physiologic, Physiological, Neurological, Neurologic, Series, Compensation, Financial compensation, insight, Individual, Measurement, Biological Function, Biological Process, Reaction, Pattern, high temperature, High temperature of physical object, electrical property, membrane structure, Membrane, Performance, voltage, neuronal circuit, neuronal circuitry, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Modeling, Property, response, voltage clamp, disease causation, causation, Causality, Etiology, extreme temperature, Address, Data, Preparation, Characteristics, Process, developmental, Development, Output, global environmental, global environment, computational studies, computer studies, designing, design, Population, Individual Differences, synaptic function, synapse function, network models, genetic makeup, genetic make-up,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temperature is a global perturbation that alters all biological reactions and processes to a greater or lesser degree. This proposal address the fundamental question of how neuronal circuits that underly behavior can be robust against temperature changes when all of the synaptic and intrinsic properties that give rise to network dynamics are altered differently by temperature. Towards this goal, experimental and computational studies of a crustacean central pattern generating network, the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) are proposed. Specific Aims include: studies of the effects of temperature on individual neurons and synapses of the pyloric circuit from animals acclimated to different temperatures; voltage-clamp characterization of the effects of temperature on six voltage and time-dependent membrane currents from STG neurons from animals acclimated to different temperatures; the effects of temperature on dynamic clamp constructed reciprocal inhibitory circuits made from pairs of isolated STG neurons; development of conductance-based single neuron models; and construction of pyloric network models to explore the robustness of circuit performance to altered temperature. These data will inform our understanding of how robust circuit performance is preserved across individuals and in response to alterations in the components of a circuit over time. These experiments will contribute to our understanding of how individuals with different sets of underlying circuit components can nonetheless respond robustly to many environmental perturbations. Additionally, these experiments will provide insight into the mechanisms by which high temperature may contribute to seizure and other neurological problems.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MARDER, EVE E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS075007</grantId><grantName>A Database of Mammalian Neuronal Cell Types</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1752613.0</amount><startDate>2012-02-01</startDate><endDate>2018-01-31</endDate><keyword>abstracting, Affect, Atlases, driving, Automobile Driving, Biology, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Brain Disorders, Brain Diseases, Brain Mapping, Cell Body, Cells, Systematics, Classification, Communities, Complement Proteins, Complement, diencephalon, Disorder, Disease, Family, γ-Aminobutyric Acid, GABA, Aminalone, Aminalon, 4-amino-butanoic acid, 4-Aminobutyric Acid, 4-Aminobutanoic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Gene Expression, Genes, Genome, glutamatergic, L-Glutamate, Glutamates, Transgenic Mice, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Mus, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Phenotype, Physiology, Reagent, recruit, active recruitment, Recruitment Activity, Research Resources, Resources, Telencephalon, Transactivators, Trans-Acting Factors, Trans-Activators, recombinase, Prosencephalon, Forebrain, Fore-Brain, Enhancers, promoter, promotor, base, Label, improved, Specified, Specific qualifier value, Link, insight, Individual, data repository, clinical data repository, Databanks, Data Bases, Data Banks, Databases, Collaborations, Genetic, Morphology, Reporter, tool, Knowledge, cell type, Location, transgenic, Transgenic Organisms, novel, member, gene expression assay, gene expression analysis, Transcript Expression Analysis, Transcript Expression Analyses, Gene Expression Pattern Analysis, Gene Expression Monitoring, Gene Expression Profiling, Sampling, Property, Transgenesis, Gene Transfer Techniques, Genomics, Brain region, Protein Family, Data, molecular signature, molecular profile, Molecular Fingerprinting, Expression Profiling, Molecular Profiling, Mouse Strains, Tet, Tetanus Helper Peptide, Ontology, Scheme, Molecular, developmental, Development, transcriptional signature, gene expression signature, gene expression pattern, Expression Signature, Gene Expression Profile, imaging informatics, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies, open source, genome-wide, genomewide, genome scale, sharing data,</keyword><description>Abstract
Neuronal cell types are the building blocks of brain function and differences between cell
types are critical to understanding nervous system disease. New genetic and genomic
resources are increasingly available for identifying and manipulating specific cell types in
the mouse. We will create a unified gateway to these reagents and a platform for
integrating and sharing data obtained with them to enhance progress on the difficult
problem of identifying the neuronal cell types of the mammalian brain. We will implement
a searchable, freely shared open source database of resources and experimental
results. We will annotate the anatomical location of targeted cell types within each of ~90
existing driver/reporter strains by aligning individual sections to the Allen Brain
Reference Atlas and will develop new strains using a novel lentiviral enhancer trap
strategy in mice. For a subset of cell types we will perform genome-gene expression
profiling to enhance insights from this unbiased metric of relationships between neuronal
cell types. We will integrate the cell type database and improved atlas viewer with tools
for viewing cell type-specific morphology, physiology and gene expression data, and will
link these data with other available brain atlas and genomic databases. The ability to
freely search and compare cell-type specific phenotypes and gene expression data will
enable members of the scientific community to develop specific hypotheses about the
molecular bases of specific cellular phenotypes and to improve schemes for classifying
neuronal cell types.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NELSON, SACHA B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01NS065856</grantId><grantName>Semaphorin-Dependent GABAergic Synapse Formation: A Novel Approach to Increasing Inhibition in the Intact Brain</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4806916.8</amount><startDate>2010-08-01</startDate><endDate>2025-04-30</endDate><keyword>21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, Benzodiazepine Compounds, Benzodiazepines, Boston, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Cell Body, Cells, Diazepam, Valium, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Electric Stimulation, Electrical Stimulation, electrostimulation, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Epilepsy, Epileptic Seizures, Epileptics, Seizure Disorder, epilepsia, epileptogenic, Future, Goals, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Pediatric Hospitals, Children's Hospital, Human, Modern Man, In Vitro, Intravenous infusion procedures, IV Infusion, intravenous infusion, Integral Membrane Protein, Intrinsic Membrane Protein, Transmembrane Protein, Transmembrane Protein Gene, Marketing, Methods, Morbidity - disease rate, Morbidity, mortality, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Persons, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Patients, Pentylenetetrazole, Leptazole, Pentamethylenetetrazole, Pentetrazole, Pentylenetetrazol, Proteins, Risk, Rodent, Rodentia, Rodents Mammals, Seizures, Signal Pathway, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Sodium Ion Channels, Sodium Channel, Generalized Status Epilepticus, Status Epilepticus, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, Time, Virus, Dentate Fascia, Fascia Dentata, Gyrus Dentatus, dentate gyrus, Peptide Domain, Protein Domains, Tertiary Protein Structure, density, Acute, Chronic, Refractory, biologic, Biological, Drug Modulation, Collaborations, Xenopus B2 antigen, plexin, sema4D, semaphorin 4D, semaphorin CD100, CD100 antigen, Therapeutic, Frequencies, Severities, Event, Route, Techniques, Viral, Infusion procedures, Infusion, infusions, receptor, Receptor Protein, success, synaptogenesis, synapse formation, trafficking, prenatal, unborn, novel, Cell surface, Reporting, neural circuit, neural circuitry, neurocircuitry, synaptic circuit, synaptic circuitry, Modeling, Intervention, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, receptor function, Semaphorins, prevent, preventing, small molecule, Address, Data, Inhibitory Synapse, in vivo, Extracellular Domain, External Domain, Rodent Model, Slice, pre-clinical, preclinical, preclinical study, pre-clinical study, Epileptogenesis, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, Neonatal, novel therapeutics, new drug treatments, new drugs, new therapeutics, new therapy, next generation therapeutics, novel drug treatments, novel drugs, novel therapy, mouse model, murine model, induced pluripotent stem cell, iPS, iPSC, iPSCs, inducible pluripotent stem cell, novel therapeutic intervention, new therapeutic approach, new therapeutic intervention, new therapeutic strategies, new therapy approaches, novel therapeutic approach, novel therapeutic strategies, novel therapy approach, FDA approved, treatment strategy, Drug Targeting, Medical emergency, Injections, optimal treatments, optimal therapies, translational potential, translatable strategy,</keyword><description>We propose to harness the synaptogenic potential of Sema4D signaling to increase
GABAergic synapse number, thus enhancing inhibition in neural circuits and suppressing
seizures. This approach could be beneficial to preventing the establishment of epilepsy, halting
its progression, or suppressing hyperexcitability during a seizure event.
 Previously our lab discovered that the extracellular domain of transmembrane protein
Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) drives inhibitory synapse formation on a remarkably fast time scale
(i.e. minutes) in hippocampal neurons and slice cultured from the pre-natal and neonatal
hippocampus. We also demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of purified, Sema4D
extracellular domain into the adult hippocampus rapidly promotes the formation of new
GABAergic synapses. Further, we reported that Sema4D treatment protects against seizures
induced by electrical stimulation of the dentate gyrus or by intravenous infusion of the
proconvulsant drug pentylenetetrazol.
 Given the success of these studies, we undertook a new experimental direction to
determine if Sema4D treatment has therapeutic potential for human epilepsies. The first aim of
this proposal is to investigate Sema4D treatment as an acute, anti-seizure therapeutic in rodent
models of status epilepticus (SE). SE is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention
in humans; approximately 30% of patients with SE are refractory to treatment with current
medications including benzodiazepines. Preliminary data presented in this proposal shows that
Sema4D treatment restored the efficacy of diazepam in a rodent model of refractory SE. This
result is consistent with our hypothesis that Sema4D treatment acutely increases the number of
GABAergic synapses in hippocampus, which maintains or re-establishes benzodiazepine
sensitivity in the brain.
 The second aim of our proposal is to determine the effect of chronic exposure of
Sema4D (via viral delivery to the CNS) on inhibitory synapse formation and ultimately, seizure
frequency and severity in rodent models of chronic epilepsy. As a first step towards this goal we
will explore the efficacy and time-course of alternative methods of administering Sema4D (e.g.
intracerebral injection of virus encoding Sema4D) to mice. In the third aim, we will begin to
address the translatability of our findings with Sema4D in rodents by asking if Sema4D
promotes inhibitory synapse formation and network activity in cultures of human neurons.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PARADIS, SUZANNE </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01MH112661</grantId><grantName>Role of physiological patterns in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2416187.0</amount><startDate>2017-04-01</startDate><endDate>2027-12-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Aging, AD dementia, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer's, Alzheimers Dementia, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, primary degenerative dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Alzheimer's Disease, driving, Automobile Driving, Behavior, Cell Body, Cells, Decision Making, Disease, Disorder, Dopamine, Hydroxytyramine, Exploratory Behavior, Future, Goals, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Immobilization, orthopedic freezing, Learning, Maintenance, Maps, Memory, Memory Disorders, Cognitive Retention Disorders, Methods, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, neurophysiology, neurophysiological, Play, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Psychological reinforcement, Reinforcement, Rewards, Rodent, Rodentia, Rodents Mammals, Role, social role, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Schizophrenia, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Sleep, Testing, Mediating, Prefrontal Cortex, ventral tegmentum, Ventral Tegmental Area, density, Medial, Physiologic, Physiological, Link, insight, awake, Dysfunction, Physiopathology, pathophysiology, Functional disorder, Cognitive Disturbance, Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive decline, Cognitive function abnormal, Disturbance in cognition, cognitive dysfunction, cognitive loss, Impaired cognition, Nature, Complex, Event, Pattern, Location, Amentia, Dementia, experience, cell assembly, neural, memory process, memory processing, novel, Code, Coding System, dopaminergic neuron, DA Neuron, Dopamine neuron, Address, autism spectrum disorder, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Early Infantile Autism, Infantile Autism, Kanner's Syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, Data, Dopaminergic Cell, Interruption, Retrieval, Monitor, Behavioral, neuromechanism, neural mechanism, flexibility, flexible, optogenetics, cognitive process, cognitive ability, memory consolidation, neuropsychiatric disorder, neuropsychiatric disease,</keyword><description>Project Summary/ Abstract
The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior.
Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for memory and cognitive processes,
however, the nature of these interactions and their roles are still unclear. We have established multiple timescale
neural representations in these regions for spatial learning and memory-guided behavior, with inter-regional
coordination during spatial firing and theta oscillations in exploratory behavior, and during sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) associated replay in sleep and awake immobility periods. Here, we will investigate the roles of these
physiological network patterns in learning and memory-guided navigation by combining behavioral methods in
rats, high-density recordings, and causal manipulation methods. (Aim 1) The influence of reward on mnemonic
representations is key to understanding the role of hippocampal-prefrontal activity patterns in memory-guided
behavior. In particular, it is known that reward changes influence hippocampal replay, and replay is thought to
play a role in linking actions to reward for reinforcement learning. To address this question directly, we have
developed methods in TH-Cre rats for optogenetic tagging and identification of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area (VTA) neurons which encode reward prediction error, simultaneously with recordings from hippocampal
and prefrontal ensembles. We will record and manipulate VTA dopamine neuron firing to examine the influence
on replay and task representations in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during learning of new spatial rules.
(Aim 2) The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are both known to be important for contextual encoding and
generalizing experiences across contexts, but the mechanisms are unclear. Our preliminary data show rule-
selective encoding by prefrontal neurons that is maintained across spatial contexts, whereas hippocampal CA1
neurons remap across contexts. Further, we have also found coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal ripples vs
independent cortical ripples with distinct reactivation patterns. We will examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal
ensembles underlie rule representations and contextual encoding, whether theta sequences maintain encoding
of current context, and test the hypothesis that replay during coordinated ripples enables associations across
contexts. (Aim 3) Goal representations are considered central to navigation, but the mechanisms for goal coding
and hippocampal-prefrontal representations for memory-guided navigation are still unclear. Our preliminary data
using a complex 2-d maze with flexible goal locations and barriers supports goal representations and replay by
hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles during navigation. We will test the hypotheses that hippocampal and
prefrontal replay events during immobility support planning of upcoming trajectories, and goal representations
impact theta sequences for online maintenance during trajectory execution. Overall, our results will provide novel
insight into fundamental learning and memory mechanisms that are affected in aging and memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>JADHAV, SHANTANU P</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01MH110391</grantId><grantName>Thalamic Mechanisms for generating abnormal low frequency oscillations relevant to Schizophrenia</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2023186.0</amount><startDate>2016-08-01</startDate><endDate>2021-05-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, Axon, Basal Ganglia, Basal Nuclei, Behavior, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Cell Nucleus, Nucleus, Cells, Cell Body, Chromosome abnormality, Aberrant Chromosome, Chromosomal Aberrations, Chromosomal Abnormalities, Chromosomal Alterations, Chromosome Aberrations, Chromosome Alterations, Chromosome Anomalies, Cytogenetic Aberrations, Cytogenetic Abnormalities, chromosomal defect, chromosome defect, Chromosome Deletion, Chromosomal Deletion, Partial Monosomy, Communication, Disease, Disorder, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Electroencephalography, EEG, Goals, Health, Hippocampus (Brain), Ammon Horn, Cornu Ammonis, Hippocampus, hippocampal, Human, Modern Man, Ketamine, Lighting, Illumination, Literature, Short-Term Memory, Immediate Memory, Shortterm Memory, working memory, Mental Processes, Methods, Motivation, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Patients, Play, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Research, Risk Factors, Role, social role, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Disorders, dementia praecox, schizophrenic, Testing, Thalamic structure, Thalamus, thalamic, Work, Generations, Measures, N-Methylaspartate, N Methyl D aspartic Acid, N methyl D aspartate, N-Methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA, base, Medial, Acute, Evaluation, Nucleus Reuniens Thalami, Reuniens Nucleus, Reuniens Thalamic Nucleus, nucleus reticularis, Failure, Memory Deficit, memory dysfunction, Memory impairment, awake, drug use, Drug usage, Therapeutic, Knowledge, cognitive function, Frequencies, System, Viral, Penetrance, membrane structure, Membrane, Performance, Isoforms, Protein Isoforms, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, model organism, Animal Model, Structure, memory recall, novel, behavioral test, behavior test, Modeling, Symptoms, Data, in vivo, Slice, 22q11.2, Preparation, Molecular, Process, Behavioral, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, inhibitory neuron, designing, design, drug detection, drug testing, murine model, mouse model, genome wide analysis, genome wide studies, genome-wide identification, genome-wide analysis, new therapeutic approach, new therapeutic intervention, new therapeutic strategies, new therapy approaches, novel therapeutic approach, novel therapy approach, novel therapeutic intervention, optogenetics, Risk-associated variant, risk allele, risk gene, risk genotype, risk loci, risk locus, risk variant, cognitive process, alleviate symptom, ameliorating symptom, decrease symptom, fewer symptoms, relieves symptoms, symptom alleviation, symptom reduction, symptom relief, reduce symptoms, experiment, experimental research, experimental study, Injections, in vivo testing, in vivo evaluation,</keyword><description>Project Description
In schizophrenia (SZ), the power of low-frequency EEG oscillations (delta/theta; 1-7 Hz) is elevated in the
awake state in subregions of the thalamocortical system. NMDAR antagonist induces similar low-frequency
oscillations and also produces many of the symptoms of SZ, thus raising the possibility that the abnormal delta
oscillations in SZ are causal in producing symptoms of the disease. Our previous work using the NMDA
hypofunction model shows that T-type Ca channels and NR2C are critical for generation of abnormal delta
oscillations. We further showed that optogenetically inducing delta oscillation in the nucleus reuniens of the
thalamus is sufficient to interfere with working memory, a cognitive process that shows deficits in SZ. This
supports the hypothesis that abnormal delta in SZ could be causal in generating disease symptoms.
Independent support for this framework for understanding SZ has come from two genome-wide studies; these
identified the same isoform of the T-type channel as a risk gene for SZ. Thus, there is strong rationale for
further understanding of how abnormal delta can produce symptoms of SZ. Furthermore, elucidation of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms may suggest new strategies for disease treatment. In Aim 1, we will further
analyze how optogenetic stimulation of the reuniens at delta frequency interferes with working memory. The
experiments are designed to determine whether the oscillations interfere with encoding or recall processes.
The goal of Aim 2 is to test, in vivo, our understanding of delta generation and to determine whether drugs that
reduce delta ameliorate symptoms in an animal model. Our specific hypothesis is that drugs that inhibit T-
channel function directly, or reduce their function by depolarizing cells (thus producing inactivation of T
channels), will reduce delta oscillations and ameliorate behavioral deficits. We have developed an in vivo
assay in which we can evoke delta oscillations by injection of ketamine into the thalamus; we will use this
model to evaluate drugs for their ability to reduce the power of these oscillations. We will further test drugs
using the Df(16)A+/- mice that have been generated to model the human chromosomal deletion 22q11.2 that is
the largest known risk factor for SZ. Consistent with the importance of delta oscillations, these mice have
elevated delta power in the awake state. With this model, we can test for drugs that reduce delta power and
determine whether these drugs ameliorate the working memory deficits in these animals. In Aim 3, we test a
novel hypothesis about the negative symptoms of SZ, symptoms that have been particularly difficult to
understand and treat. This explanation is built on a proposal by Graybiel/Surmeier according to which activity
in the parafasicular/centro-medial (PF/CM) nucleus of the thalamus preferentially activates the indirect (NoGo)
pathway of the basal ganglia. Activity in the indirect (NoGo) pathway is thought to inhibit behavior and could
thus produce avolition. We will use optogenetic methods to test whether imposing delta oscillations in PF/CM
produces avolition.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KATZ, DONALD B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01MH102841</grantId><grantName>CRCNS: Network Mechanisms Underlying Episodic Memory</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>817090.0</amount><startDate>2013-08-23</startDate><endDate>2016-06-30</endDate><keyword>Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Cells, Data Analysis, Data Analyses, Disadvantaged, ethical, Ethics, fire, Fires, Fire - disasters, Goals, hippocampal, Hippocampus, Cornu Ammonis, Ammon Horn, Hippocampus (Brain), Incidence, Laboratories, Maps, Memory, Methods, Minor, National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.), Neurosciences, Rats Mammals, Rat, Common Rat Strains, Rattus, Students, Testing, Work, Dataset, Data Set, Gyrus Dentatus, Fascia Dentata, Dentate Fascia, dentate gyrus, Phase, insight, Knowledge, lectures, programs, Event, Sensory, Pattern, post-doctoral, post-doc, Research Associate, Postdoc, Postdoctoral Fellow, Episodic memory, experience, neural, relating to nervous system, Structure, skills, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Position, Positioning Attribute, Coding System, Code, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, neural circuit, underserved minority, under-represented minority, Underrepresented Populations, Underrepresented Groups, Underrepresented Minority, Principal Investigator, Process, therapeutic target, hippocampal subregions, population aging, aging population, optogenetics,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: Although considerable progress has been made in understanding how episodic memory is stored in the brain, fundamental questions remain. We will use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to study two major questions. Aim 1: Network mechanisms of sequence recall in the hippocampus: Our ability to recall a sequence of events is a core component of episodic memory. The hippocampus is necessary for episodic memory, and electrophysiological recordings from this structure have begun to reveal some of the processes involved. After a rat experiences a spatial path, it recalls sequences of places along that path during brief events called sharp waves. Recent experiments show that these waves are necessary for memory consolidation. Sharp waves are generated intrahippocampally, but the specific hippocampal subregions that produce them are not known. According to one hypothesis, CA3 alone generates the sharp wave. Another hypothesis (the ping-pong hypothesis) posits that sharp waves are generated by the combined action of the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3.This hypothesis has its origins in the work of Sompolinsky and Kleinfeld, who argued that each cycle in sequence recall requires two substeps: a) a chaining substep in which cells representing one item stimulate the cells representing the next item in the sequence and b) an autoassociative substep that corrects minor errors produced in each chaining step, thereby avoiding concatenation of error. Lisman proposed how this could be mapped onto hippocampal circuitry: CA3 cells that represent the nth item in the sequence excite the n+1 item in the DG (by the known backprojections); then, the n+1 item in DG is sent to CA3 for error correction (pattern completion). This, in turn, initiates te next cycle. To distinguish between the ping-pong and CA3-alone hypotheses, J. Leutgeb will record simultaneously from dentate and CA3. She will determine whether both dentate and CA3 cells fire during sharp waves and whether they fire at a different phase of gamma oscillations, as would be expected from a ping-pong process. To test whether accurate sequence recall in CA3 requires the dentate, Leutgeb will use optogenetic methods. If the dentate is required, accurate sequence recall should be disrupted by artificially inducing activity in the dentate or by
blocking activity in the dentate. The data analysis will be done in the Lisman laboratory. Aim 2: Neural coding in the hippocampus: Two key experiments have provided insight into how spatial and sensory information are encoded in the hippocampus. O'Keefe showed that different spatial positions in a sequence are represented in different phases of a theta cycle. The Moser lab demonstrated that sensory information is encoded by "rate remapping": sensory information associated with a place is encoded by a change in the firing RATE of the place cells that encode that position. It is unclear whether these major ideas are compatible: the increased number of spikes during rate remapping might smear theta phase and thereby compromise phase coding. To determine whether this is the case, Lisman will analyze an existing data set and a new data set to be obtained by Leutgeb. Our working hypothesis is that rate remapping increases the number of spikes in a brief burst; since the spikes in a burst have nearly the same theta phase, phase coding would not be significantly degraded.    
Broader Impact: Understanding memory is a major goal of neuroscience because of the increasing incidence of memory problems in an aging population. The proposed experiment will identify a key component of the neural circuitry that underlies episodic memory. This may enable more targeted therapeutic strategies. A second contribution will be a MATLAB tutorial for the Summer Program in Neuroscience, Ethics and Survival (SPINES). This is an NIMH-sponsored course aimed at helping grad students and postdocs from under-represented minority and disadvantaged groups to develop knowledge and skills. Lisman and Leutgeb will lecture on major advances in episodic memory and describe how computation is important in this endeavor. This will be followed by a one-month tutorial on the computational platform MATLAB.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LISMAN, JOHN E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01MH096809</grantId><grantName>Clinical Inertia in Prescribing for Bipolar Disorder</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>667335.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-18</startDate><endDate>2016-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Attitude, Behavior, manic depressive illness, manic depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, Manic-Depressive Psychosis, Bipolar Affective Psychosis, Bipolar Disorder, Clinical Markers, clinical investigation, Clinical Trials, Data Analysis, Data Analyses, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Family, Future, Health, Health Planning, History, Recording of previous events, Hospitalization, Li+ element, Lithium, Medicaid, Medicine, National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.), Patients, Perception, Physicians, social role, Role, Savings, Societies, Measures, Healthcare Costs, Health Costs, Health Care Costs, Dataset, Data Set, Caring, base, dosage, improved, Area, Clinical, Variation, Variant, Medical, failure, FLR, Failure (biologic function), Funding, Patient Nonadherence, Patient Non-Adherence, Patient Non Compliance, Patient Noncompliance, programs, Pattern, Visit, experience, treatment adverse effect, therapy adverse effect, side effect, Treatment Side Effects, Adverse effects, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Provider, Address, Dose, Adherence, Adherence (attribute), Data, multi site clinical trial, multi site clinical study, multi center clinical trial, multi center clinical study, Multi-site clinical trial, Multi-site clinical study, Multi-center clinical trial, Multi-center clinical study, Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial, trial treatment, trial regimen, Clinical Treatment, Characteristics, medication adherence, medication compliance, cost, Outcome, Prevalence, clinical effect, comparative effectiveness, treatment design, intervention design, therapy design, public health relevance, effective treatment, effective therapy, treatment adherence, Regimen,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotropic medications are a mainstay of effective treatment for bipolar disorder, but many patients fail to adhere to their medication regimens, for reasons including side effects and nonresponse. In many cases, timely medication adjustments could avert this non-adherence, but appropriate medication adjustments are not made, a phenomenon known elsewhere in medicine as 'clinical inertia'. Thus, dealing with clinical inertia could improve medication adherence. This study aims to provide information about the current extent of clinical inertia, its predictors, and its impact on medication adherence among patients with bipolar disorder (BD), in order to identify areas for possible improvement. In addition, we hypothesize that reducing clinical inertia would increase spending on medication costs, since greater adherence would prolong treatment. However, we hypothesize that this increase in medication costs would be more than offset by savings on hospitalization and other health care costs. The study aims are to: 1) Measure the extent and predictors of clinical inertia in medication treatment of BD. Specifically: a) to measure the proportion of visits in which no medication adjustment occurs, overall and specifically where an adjustment appears clinically indicated, and b) identify which patient and physician characteristics predict pharmacologic treatment adjustment at each visit following establishment of initial regimen. 2) Measure the association between clinical inertia (measured as lack of medication adjustment where indicated) and the degree of medication adherence. Identify what rate of treatment adjustment is associated with the highest level of medication adherence. 3) Determine whether increased use of clinically indicated medication adjustments would reduce total health care costs, despite increasing medication costs. The study aims will be accomplished through analysis of data from two naturalistic multi-site clinical trials of treatment for BD: the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), and the Lithium Moderate Use Study (LiTMUS). These datasets include detailed longitudinal information on patients' clinical status and prescribed medications at each visit. The study will help to understand the extent of and effects of clinical inertia, a problem that has not been systematically studied for BD despite recent findings for other diseases. To the extent that clinical inertia contributes to medication non-adherence, our results will lay the basis for future interventions to address this problem.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manipulating the activity of identified neurons in brain circuits is essential for studying how they are organized and how they produce behavior. Manipulating circuit activity can also be used to treat neurological and psychiatric diseases including Parkinson's Disease, depression and epilepsy. Optogenetic tools have revolutionized our ability to manipulate neuronal activity. We propose to create a set of complementary thermogenetic tools. These have the potential to reliably provide stronger levels of activation and may be activated with less invasive stimulus delivery systems. At present, such tools are used exclusively in flies. We propose to modify these tools to optimize them for use in mammalian systems.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large amplitude, global EEG oscillations in the delta/theta frequency range are normally characteristic of slow-wave sleep. In schizophrenia, however, delta power is high during wakefulness in frontal and central regions. This has been termed a thalamocortical dysrhythmia. Many symptoms of schizophrenia can be induced by NMDAR antagonists; work in rats shows that a delta frequency dysrhythmia can be induced by injection of NMDAR antagonist into the thalamus. The first goal of our work is to understand how NMDAR antagonists generate this abnormality. Our preliminary results point to a cellular mechanism: cells of the nucleus reticularis (nRT) of the thalamus are hyperpolarized by NMDAR antagonist; this deinactivates T-type Ca2+ channels which then generate delta frequency bursting. Our second goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of this effect. Our preliminary results confirm in situ hybridization showing that thalamic cells contain a rare form of NMDAR subunit, NR2C. This subunit is weakly blocked by Mg2+ at resting potential and thus generates a significant inward current in response to ambient glutamate; block of this current leads to the hyperpolarization that produces delta- frequency bursting. Thus our work points to a molecular/cellular mechanism for dysrhythmia. The third goal of our work is to understand how dopamine interacts with these processes. Our preliminary results suggest that D2 action may be synergistic with NMDA hypofunction in producing dysrhythmia. We will study this process in vivo to determine whether the delta oscillations induced by NMDA hypofunction can be reduced by D2 antagonist. A critical aspect of the dysrhythmia hypothesis, as proposed by R. Llinas, is that subregions of the thalamus generate abnormal low frequency oscillations in associated subregions of cortex; this produces local deficits in information processing that underlie the symptoms of the disease. A final goal of our work is to test this hypothesis. We will use a CRE-recombinase method to produce postdevelopmental knockout of NMDARs in subregions of the nRT. We will test whether NMDAR knockout in anterior nRT can produce enhancement of delta power in the frontal/central regions affected in schizophrenia, without affecting occipital cortex. We will test whether behaviors mediated by these regions are selectively affected by these oscillations. Because the CRE- recombinase method produces chronic changes, it provides a model system for identifying the chronic processes that underlie schizophrenia and drug therapy. If successful, this mouse will model the EEG symptoms of schizophrenia and provide a system in which potential therapeutic targets can be identified, based on the known pharmacology of the thalamus, and then tested for their ability to reverse the EEG symptoms.

grown enormously with the increasingly global and 24 hour nature of our society, and costs are in the
billions. In spite of this, however, we know very little about the mechanisms by which sleep influences
memory circuits. Memory formation is bidirectionally sensitive to sleep levels. Sleep in the temporal
window following training can enhance formation of memory, while sleep deprivation has negative
effects on its formation. In addition, learning has been shown to enhance sleep drive, suggesting that
there are intrinsic mechanisms to promote sleep during memory formation. In Drosophila, we have a
very detailed understanding both of the processes that underlie memory formation and sleep circuits.
This proposal leverages this knowledge to understand, for the first time at a cellular level, the direct
links between memory and sleep systems.
 In Aim 1 we will dissect the organization and functionality of co-transmission in the DPM
neurons, a cell type critical for both long-term memory formation and learning-dependent sleep. These
cells release multiple transmitters and understanding how these transmitters are deployed in the circuit
will be important for understanding their functions.
 In Aim 2 we probe the regulation and plasticity of co-transmitter release in DPM. We
hypothesize that target-selective release of the two transmitters imposes differences in the timing and
amplitude of signals which will have profound effects on computations in the circuit.
 In Aim 3 we ask how co-transmission affects circuit dynamics. The core challenge we face
today in our understanding of sleep and memory formation is to understand the dynamics of the circuit.
In this aim we use functional imaging to map the temporal relationships in the MB circuit and the role of

Mechanisms that ensure or promote resilience must exist on a large variety of time scales, from
milliseconds to years for long-lived animals such as humans. Moreover, many psychiatric
disorders may be expressed as a lack of resilience to a variety of stresses, so understanding the
fundamental principles and cellular mechanisms that promote resilience in individuals and the
population will provide a set of backbone concepts that will inform our understanding of the loss
of resilience seen in mental illnesses. This computational/theoretical project will explore a
number of hypotheses and potential mechanisms that may contribute to increasing the
resilience of neurons and circuits to perturbation. Specific Aim #1 will explore the hypothesis
that neurons with multiple voltage-dependent currents with overlapping properties will be more
resilient to perturbation than neurons with fewer currents. Specific Aim #2 will characterize
and explore the dynamic range of small reciprocally inhibitory circuits in response to
perturbation. Of particular interest is whether resilience at one level of organization percolates
to the next level. Specific Aim #3 will study a newly refined model of homeostatic tuning of
intrinsic excitability and determine if homeostatic changes in response to a single, short-term
perturbation result in changes of resilience towards repeat presentations of the same
perturbation or qualitatively different perturbations. These studies may provide insight into
how repeated insults “accrue” to produce long-term changes in mental health.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MARDER, EVE E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01HL105949</grantId><grantName>Channels with KCNE Subunits: Conformational Dynamics</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1511408.0</amount><startDate>2011-07-15</startDate><endDate>2015-11-30</endDate><keyword>bear, Ursidae, Bears, Ursidae Family, Biology, circulatory system, Heart Vascular, Cardiovascular system (all sites), Cardiovascular Organ System, Cardiovascular Body System, Cardiovascular, Cardiovascular system, Cells, Colon, Conflict, Conflict (Psychology), Diagnosis, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, Ear, Ear structure, Energy Transfer, Environment, Physical Exercise, Exercise, Fluorescence, Goals, Health, Heart, heart disorder, Cardiac Disorders, Cardiac Diseases, Heart Diseases, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Human Activities, Membrane Channels, Ionic Channels, Ion Channel, Ions, Kinetics, Learning, Locales, Maintenance, Medicine, Methods, Microscopy, Mink, Structural Models, body movement, Movement, Persons, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, optical, Optics, Peptides, Pharmacology, Physiology, K element, Potassium, gene product, Proteins, Research, Rest, Testing, Time, Wit, Work, Measures, base, Organ, sensor, improved, Site, Phase, Variation, Variant, Physiologic, Physiological, Lanthanoids, Lanthanides, Lanthanoid Series Elements, Link, heart function, insight, Measurement, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Functional disorder, tool, Knowledge, Investigation, Hereditary, Inherited, Dependence, Techniques, Location, stoichiometry, V (voltage), voltage, Structure, disease risk, disorder risk, Reporting, Voltage-Gated K+ Channels, Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel, Regulation, Modeling, LOINC Axis 2 Property, Property, response, single molecule, Photobleaching, muscle system, muscular system, Pharmacological Substance, Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceutical Agent, Pharmacologic Substance, Address, Data, in vivo, Scheme, Process, Cardiac, computational tools, computerized tools, Outcome, operation,</keyword><description>  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to determine how voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are controlled by KCNE subunits. Also called MinK-related peptides (MiRPs), these single-pass transmembrane accessory subunits merit investigation because they are required for normal function of the heart and other organs that depend on Kv channels. MiRPs exert their powerful effects by assembly with Kv channel pore-forming subunits and thereby direct location and level, voltage-sensitivity, time- dependence, unitary conductance, ion selectivity, and response to regulators and pharmaceuticals. Identifying and studying MiRPs has advanced diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. The significance of this application is two-fold. First, we have learned a great deal about what MiRPs do in the heart over the last decade but not yet how they do it. Second, tools are now available to delineate conformational dynamics, that is, the mechanistic basis for protein operation in real-time. Here, powerful optical, electrophysiological and modeling techniques are brought to bear on channels as they form in cells, a capability unimaginable just a decade ago. The result is no less than this: we can now answer basic, outstanding questions in human physiology and disease. The three aims focus on operation of two important channels formed by the same pore-forming Kv subunit (Kv7.1 = KCNQ1 = Q1) and two different MiRPs (MinK = E1 and MiRP2 = E3). The study addresses questions at the core of physiology. To wit: why does IKs (Q1 + E1) in the heart and ear respond slowly to voltage? How does IK (Q1 + E3) found in heart and colon react instantaneously to voltage? These normal functions are disrupted by inherited differences and acquired disease. More basically, the study can reveal key principles of operation of voltage sensors and gates and the impact of accessory subunits; these insights have relevance throughout the body.

reproductive health care services and health information. Specifically, the lack of effective communication,
such as sign language interpreters, hinders access to reproductive health care services and information for
DHH women. While women who are DHH are equally likely to be pregnant as women with other disabilities
and women without disabilities, there is almost no information and research about their pregnancy
experiences, maternal and birth outcomes, and associated healthcare costs. Preliminary findings from the
investigator team demonstrate that DHH women are at substantial risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Efforts to improve their pregnancy care and experiences while reducing costs require a definitive assessment
of these women's pregnancy risks and outcomes. The overarching goal of this study is to use a mixed-
methods approach to understand pregnancy experiences, maternal and birth outcomes, related health care
costs, and unmet perinatal health care needs of DHH women and their infants. The specific aims of this study
are: 1) Compare pregnancy and childbirth complications, outcomes, and inpatient costs among DHH and non-
DHH women using nationally-representative 2008-13 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide
Inpatient Sample data; 2) Examine longitudinal health outcomes and healthcare utilization and costs of DHH
women around the time of their pregnancy and for their infants (up to 1 year of age) compared to other women
using linked data from the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal – All Payer Claims Database;
and 3) Identify unmet needs and barriers to pregnancy and perinatal care for DHH women through (a)
interviews with DHH mothers, (b) a national survey of the unmet needs and barriers to pregnancy and perinatal
care of DHH mothers who have given birth in the last 5 years, and (c) interviews with clinicians who provide
their health care. This information will be used to generate practice recommendations to improve the perinatal
health of DHH women and their infants. Our study will lead to a first-ever systematic understanding of
pregnancy and infant health outcomes and pregnancy care costs for DHH women, thus establishing a
foundation for development and testing of future interventions to improve outcomes. This study will fill a critical
knowledge gap in the understanding of the pregnancy-related experiences among DHH women before, during
and after pregnancy.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MITRA, MONIKA </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01HD082105</grantId><grantName>Improving Pregnancy Outcomes of Women with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2785087.0</amount><startDate>2015-01-01</startDate><endDate>2021-12-31</endDate><keyword>Data Bases, Perinatal Care, tool, Life, Intellectual functioning disability, intellectual and developmental disability, Intellectual limitation, Intellectual disability, Country, stillbirth, stillborn, American, experience, peer, social, Sampling, response, Intervention, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, 1 year old, one year old, one year of age, aged one year, aged 1 year, age 1 year, 1 year of age, Vulnerable Populations, vulnerable group, Provider, Childbirth, child birth, Address, Reproductive Rights, Reproduction Rights, Data, Development, developmental, Health Professional, Healthcare professional, Health Care Professional, cost, Outcome, Population, perinatal health, infant outcome, public health relevance, population based, Healthy People 2020, improved outcome, adverse pregnancy outcome, health service use, health service utilization, women with disabilities, disabled women, care costs, Economics, Emergencies, Emergency Situation, Eugenics, Foundations, Future, Goals, Health, treatment provider, medical personnel, healthcare personnel, health workforce, health provider, health care worker, health care personnel, Healthcare worker, Healthcare Providers, Health Care Providers, Health Personnel, Hospital Admission, Hospitalization, Hospitals, Incidence, Infant, low birthweight, low birth weight infant human, low birth weight, Low Birth Weight Infant, Information Technology Systems, IT Systems, Data Systems, Information Systems, Inpatients, Interview, Telephone Interviews, Laws, hospital stay, hospital length of stay, hospital days, Number of Days in Hospital, Length of Stay, Literature, Massachusetts, Methods, Methodology, Mothers, body movement, Movement, Persons, National Health Services, Obstetrics, Discipline of obstetrics, Out-patients, Outpatients, pilot study, Pilot Projects, pregnancy toxemia/hypertension, Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis, Pregnancy Toxemias, Preeclampsia, EPH Gestosis, Pre-Eclampsia, Gestation, Pregnancy, pregnancy-related complications, complications during pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Pregnancy Outcome, pregnant mothers, expecting mother, expectant mother, Pregnant Women, prenatal visit, prenatal checkup, prenatal appointment, pregnancy care, Prenatal care, Recommendation, Research, Risk, Stigmatization, Survey Instrument, Surveys, Testing, Time, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Health and Human Services, United States Dept. of Health and Human Services, Woman, Generations, Female Health, Women's Health, Healthcare Costs, Health Costs, Health Care Costs, health care, Healthcare, Caring, preterm delivery, premature delivery, premature childbirth, Preterm Birth, Prematurely delivering, Premature Birth, improved, Infant Health, Link, Individual, health care service utilization, healthcare utilization, healthcare service utilization, healthcare service use, health care service use, Health Care Utilization, Databases, data base,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prior studies suggest that women with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their infants are at elevated risk of having adverse obstetric health outcomes.

Next, focus groups will be conducted of women with mobility disabilities to learn about their unmet needs and barriers to perinatal care. Using these data, a follow-up survey will be devised for women with and without disabilities identified in the Massachusetts PRAMS to document their unmet needs, experiences, and outcomes related to their pregnancy.

Regulation of RNA metabolism is emerging as a major regulatory hub for gene expression control in tissues
like the brain and the muscle, which don't undergo cell division. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a
strong link between perturbation of RNA metabolism and a number of muscular and neurodegenerative
diseases including myotonic dystrophy (MD) and amyotrophic lateral dystrophy (ALS). For example, MD- 1
is provoked by expansions of CTG repeats, which result in the sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1
encoded by the gene muscleblind-1. MBNL1 and another member of the MBL family (MBNL2) have
important and overlapping functions in RNA processing and transport, in particular in muscle and neurons.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a highly abundant, not well-characterized type of non-coding RNA. These
RNAs are generated by circularization of specific exons, and their functionality is still controversial. Recent
work from my laboratory has demonstrated that circRNA production competes with pre-mRNA splicing,
suggesting that circRNAS are general cis regulators of gene expression. We found by study of MBL, the
Drosophila homolog of MBNL1, that this protein regulates the production of a subset of circRNAs,
including one generated from its own locus (circMbl). Strikingly, we noticed that the same exon of MBNL1
generates circRNAs in humans and that circMbl production in mammals can also be induced by MBL.
Additional unpublished work from my lab demonstrates that a subset of circRNAs is translated. One of these
translated circRNAs is circMbl. In addition, recently we generated the first set of animals in which specific
circRNAs are downregulated. Many circRNA knockdown strains display strong developmental and
physiological phenotypes, demonstrating for the first time functionality of circRNA molecules in vivo.
circMbl knockdown leads to male embryonic lethality, defects in wing posture, and deficits in synaptic
vesicular function.
Here we aim to unravel the molecular and physiological implications of circMbl production and
function. This work will result in pioneer functional characterization of circRNAs in vivo and will be key for
understanding how MBL production and function is regulated in vivo. For doing so we will: Characterize
the functional relationship between MBL and circMbl; determine spatial, temporal, and functional
requirements of circMbl expression and determine molecular mechanism of action of circMbl during
development and in adults. This project will illuminate essential regulatory mechanisms of mbl expression
and function, processes intimately related to MD pathogenesis. In addition, this project is both technically
and intellectually innovative in its analysis of the roles of circRNAs in central aspects of physiology, and
behavior. Our project builds on strong preliminary results and the unique and constantly evolving expertise
of our group.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KADENER, SEBASTIAN </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM117034</grantId><grantName>FOXO Regulon and Translation Control</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1267645.62</amount><startDate>2016-05-06</startDate><endDate>2021-04-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, inhibitor/antagonist, inhibitor, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Malignant Neoplasms, neoplasm/cancer, malignancy, Malignant Tumor, Cancers, Cellular Growth, Cellular Expansion, cell growth, Cell Body, Cells, Cues, diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Family, Gene Expression, Genes, living system, Organism, Pathology, Play, Proteins, Ribosomes, mRNA, Messenger RNA, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Stress, Testing, Transcription factor genes, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, General Transcription Factors, General Transcription Factor Gene, Basal transcription factor genes, Basal Transcription Factor, transcription factor, Translating, Translations, Work, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, related to A and C-protein, rac protein kinase, proto-oncogene protein akt, proto-oncogene protein RAC, c-akt protein, RAC-PK protein, Protein Kinase B, Akt protein, AKT, base, sensor, Regulon, Link, Ensure, Gene Targeting, Investigation, Endocrine, Cell Proliferation, Cellular Proliferation, Cell Multiplication, Cell Growth in Number, Protein Biosynthesis, protein synthesis, Ribosomal Protein Synthesis, Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis, Nutrient, Agreement, Regulation, response, Small Interfering RNA, siRNA, Short interfering RNA, MicroRNAs, miRNAs, miRNA, Micro RNA, Transcriptional Control, Transcription Regulation, Transcriptional Regulation, RNA synthesis, RNA chemical synthesis, Small RNA, FRAP1 gene, mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, RAFT1, Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin, FRAP2, FRAP1, FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1, FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1, Human Pathology, Immune Targeting, Internal Ribosome Entry Site, Ribosome Entry Site, Internal Ribosome Entry Segment, IRES, mRNA Expression, mTOR Signaling Pathway, Transcript, Translation Initiation, Translational Regulation, Process, Pathway interactions, pathway, age effect, aging effect, human disease, public health relevance, Growth Factor, Proteins Growth Factors, Growth Substances, Growth Agents, experimental study, experimental research, experiment,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays central roles in the pathology of several human diseases including cancer and diabetes. This pathway is a sensor of energy status, nutrient availability, stress and endocrine growth factors. In response to
these cues the pathway modulates cell growth and proliferation. Part of this control is through regulating both protein and RNA synthesis. The pathway ensures that new proteins are translated only when conditions are favorable, while RNA synthesis is regulated by activation or inactivation of the Forkhead-box family O (FOXO) transcription factors. We have identified the direct targets of FOXO and find a connection between FOXO targets and translation initiation. Negative regulators of initiation are overrepresented in the identified set of FOXO targets suggesting a connection between the branch of the AKT/mTOR pathway that controls RNA synthesis and the branch that controls protein synthesis. Several of the newly identified FOXO targets are immune to the translational regulation imposed by the AKT/mTOR pathway. We believe this provides a mechanism for integrating the regulation of protein synthesis with transcriptional regulation of genes that are targets of this pathway. We hypothesize that: the AKT/mTOR pathway changes translational profiles through FOXO by controlling the expression of multiple translational inhibitors. To test the generality of this idea, we propose to determine the efficiency of translation of specific transcripts by profiling mRNAs being actively translated during expression of an activated FOXO. We will also define the direct FOXO targets that are responsible for this effect and functionally characterize their effects. In addition, we find that he small RNA pathway is dramatically affected by activated FOXO. Changes in small RNAs also have the potential to extensively change the translation profile of the cell, so we will define the
effect of FOXO on small RNAs. The work in this proposal will illuminate an underappreciated integration of gene expression from mRNA synthesis through protein synthesis.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MARR, MICHAEL THOMAS</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM115356</grantId><grantName>Mechanism by which the Grp94 molecular chaperone folds insulin-like growth factors</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2819445.0</amount><startDate>2015-09-01</startDate><endDate>2024-06-30</endDate><keyword>inhibitor, Antineoplastic Agents, Anti-Cancer Agents, Antineoplastic Drugs, Antineoplastics, Cancer Drug, Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents, Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents, anti-cancer drug, anticancer agent, anticancer drug, Attention, Binding Sites, Combining Site, Reactive Site, Client, Clinical Trials, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Ergastoplasm, Family, Goals, Golgi Apparatus, Golgi, Golgi Complex, Molecular Conformation, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Stereochemistry, conformation, conformational state, Proteins, social role, Role, Insulin-Like Growth Factors, Sulfation Factor, insulinlike growth factor, Somatomedins, Testing, Dissociation, Biological, biologic, Chaperone, Molecular Chaperones, 70-kD Heat-Shock Protein, HSP 70, HSP70, hsp70 Family, Heat-Shock Proteins 70, Complex, Peptide Hormone Gene, peptide hormone, novel, member, Property, insulin secretion, IGF2, IGF2 gene, Oncogenic, Drug Targeting, Growth Factor, Growth Agents, Growth Substances, Proteins Growth Factors,</keyword><description>Project Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone Grp94 is required for the correct folding and secretion of insulin-like
growth factors (IGF), but the underlying mechanism is not understood. Our goal is to discover how Grp94 assists
the folding of IGF proteins. Grp94 is a member of the Hsp90 chaperone family, which require ATP-driven
conformational cycling to chaperone their “client proteins”. Many oncogenic proteins depend on Hsp90 for their
function. As a result, ATP-competitive inhibitors of Hsp90 have been extensively investigated as anti-cancer
drugs. Although cytosolic Hsp90s were the first intended targets of inhibitors in clinical trials, Grp94 is receiving
increasing attention as a drug target. Grp94 can receive clients from BiP, the Hsp70-family chaperone in the ER.
Through a chance discovery, we have found that the combination of BiP and Hsp90 inhibitors locks Grp94 in a
novel conformation, a state apparently poised for client transfer from BiP to Grp94. Client transfer from BiP to
Grp94 requires two sequential steps: handover of the client from BiP to Grp94, followed by BiP dissociation from
the ternary complex. Our first hypothesis is that Hsp90 inhibitors block both steps: Hsp90 inhibitors stall Grp94
and BiP in a client transfer state because ATP-dependent conformational changes of Grp94 are required
to handover the client from BiP and then displace BiP from Grp94. We will test this hypothesis with IGF2,
as we have discovered that this Grp94 client also has a well-defined BiP binding site. Aim1: Determine whether
ATP-dependent conformational changes of Grp94 cause BiP to handover a bound client protein, and whether
Hsp90 inhibitors disrupt this client-transfer function. Aim2: Determine whether ATP-dependent conformational
changes of Grp94 are required to actively displace BiP from Grp94. Aims 1&amp;2 will test a unified mechanism that
can explain how Hsp90 inhibitors disrupt Grp94 function, but does not explain what essential chaperoning
function is provided by BiP and Grp94 for IGF proteins. We have discovered that IGF2 forms dynamic oligomers.
Similar to other peptide hormones that are known to oligomerize, this self-association may enable IGF2 to be
effectively concentrated and packaged prior to its export to the Golgi. Despite a plausible biological role for IGF2
oligomerization, we have also observed that IGF2 can transition from dynamic reversible oligomers to irreversible
aggregates. Thus, our second hypothesis is that the essential chaperoning function of BiP and Grp94 is to
maintain a dynamic oligomerization state of IGF2. This idea is tested in Aim3: Determine the influence of
Grp94 and BiP on the oligomerization properties of ProIGF2.</description><investigator><investigatorId>STREET, TIMOTHY OLIVER</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM110382</grantId><grantName>Selective Nitrogen Atom Transfer for Applications in Biomedical Sciences</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1845775.6</amount><startDate>2014-05-01</startDate><endDate>2023-02-28</endDate><keyword>Alkenes, Olefins, Amination, Amines, amine, Amino Acids, aminoacid, Amino Alcohols, aminoalcohol, Biomedical Research, Pharmaceutic Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Clinical Study, Clinical Research, Foundations, Goals, Hydrocarbons, Indoles, Metals, Methods, Nitrogen, Research, Science, Hydroxyl, Hydroxyl Radical, Mediating, base, method development, Biological, Series, analog, Iron, Fe element, tool, Reaction, functional group, novel, Transition Elements, transition metal, drug discovery, Indole Alkaloids, Pharmacological Substance, Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceutical Agent, Pharmacologic Substance, small molecule, Organic Synthesis, Development, developmental, innovation, innovative, innovate, public health relevance,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
 Numerous pharmaceuticals contain at least one nitrogen atom and many of those nitrogen atoms are
directly attached to stereogenic centers. Therefore, synthetic methods that incorporate selective nitrogen atom
transfer to readily available hydrocarbons are important tools for the synthesis of these valuable molecules.
While methods for selective olefin aziridination and direct CH amination are well-established, methods for
direct difunctionalization of olefins with a nitrogen atom and a range of heteroatom-based functional groups are
less explored yet critically important to organic synthesis and its applications to the biomedical sciences. In
particular, a general and selective nitrogen atom transfer approach that can achieve the aminohydroxylation,
aminofluorination, and aminohalogenation of a wide variety of olefins has yet to be discovered.
 Our long-term goal is to develop selective and general nitrogen atom transfer methods that directly
difunctionalize a wide variety of olefins with a nitrogen and a range of heteroatom-based functional groups. The
objective of the proposed research is to develop a series of iron-catalyzed nitrogen atom transfer methods for
direct olefin difunctionalization with an emphasis on aminohydroxylation, aminofluorination, and
aminohalogenation. Based upon our preliminary discoveries, our underlying hypothesis is that a unique iron-
nitrenoid can be modulated to mediate a range of olefin difunctionalization reactions rather than only precedent
aziridination and CH amination reactions. The proposed research will explore this hypothesis in the context of
two Specific Aims. First, we plan to develop iron-catalyzed, selective aminohydroxylation methods that will
incorporate a variety of olefin and heteroarene substrates for synthesis of amino alcohols and -hydroxyl
amino acids. Second, we will develop iron-catalyzed, selective aminofluorination and aminohalogenation
methods for a range of olefins that will afford -fluoro, chloro, and bromo amines as well as -fluoro and chloro
amino acids.
 The proposed approach is innovative because it explores the new reactivity of an iron-nitrenoid in a
context that significantly departs from the established reactivity of metal-nitrenoids. The proposed research is
significant because it will lay the foundation for the development of a wide range of methods for selective olefin
difunctionalization from the same type of reactive intermediate generated from a first-row transition metal.
Completion of the proposed research will provide an array of unique olefin difunctionalization methods that
would become valuable tools for medicinal chemists. Furthermore, it will also produce a variety of valuable
synthetic building blocks and biologically important molecules that will accelerate the basic biomedical and
clinical research.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, HAO </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM108021</grantId><grantName>Computational modeling of viral capsid and bacterial microcompartment assembly</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2703073.94</amount><startDate>2008-12-01</startDate><endDate>2018-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Antibiotics, Antibiotic Agents, Antibiotic Drugs, Miscellaneous Antibiotic, Antiviral Agents, Antiviral Drugs, Antivirals, anti-viral agents, anti-viral drugs, anti-virals, Bacteria, Behavior, Biology, Capsid, Cells, Cell Body, Charge, Computing Methodologies, computational methodology, computational methods, computer based method, computer methods, computing method, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Equilibrium, balance, balance function, Family, Goals, Grant, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Human, Modern Man, Learning, Membrane Lipids, Cell Membrane Lipids, Microscopy, Molecular Conformation, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Stereochemistry, conformation, conformational state, Nucleic Acids, Organelles, Peptides, Genetic Polymorphism, polymorphism, Proteins, Mass Spectrum Analysis, Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis, Mass Spectrometry, Mass Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrum, Mass Spectrum Analyses, Simian virus 40, Polyomavirus macacae, Polyomavirus maccacae 1, SV 40, SV 40 Virus, SV40, SV40 Virus, Simian Vacuolating Virus 40, Vacuolating Agent, vacuolating virus, Testing, Time, Viral Proteins, Viral Gene Products, Viral Gene Proteins, virus protein, Virion, Virus Particle, Virus Replication, viral multiplication, viral replication, virus multiplication, Virus, Work, Roentgen Rays, X-Radiation, X-Ray Radiation, X-ray, Xray, base, improved, Encapsulated, Phase, Link, Individual, Virus Assembly, viral assembly, fluid, liquid, Liquid substance, Morphology, Knowledge, Reaction, Techniques, System, 3-D, 3D, three dimensional, 3-Dimensional, Viral, light scattering, membrane structure, Membrane, physical property, carbon fixation, Base Pairing, Structure, simulation, novel, Pathogenesis, Modeling, Property, response, protein protein interaction, Genomics, Coat Proteins, Viral Coat Proteins, Viral Outer Coat Protein, Capsid Proteins, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Metabolic Pathway, small molecule, Length, Data, Detection, Resolution, Viral Pathogenesis, virus pathogenesis, Monitor, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, self assembly, computerized tools, computational tools, design, designing, Population, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, Hepatitis B Virus, HBV, Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus, predictive test, predictive assay, Grain, Computer Models, Computerized Models, computational modeling, computational models, computer based models, computerized modeling,</keyword><description>In many virus families, replication requires that hundreds to thousands of proteins assemble around the viral
nucleic acid to form a protein shell called a capsid. Understanding the assembly pathways for capsid formation
and learning how antiviral drugs can block or alter these pathways would provide information to develop new
antiviral strategies and improve existing ones. Similarly, at least 20% of bacterial species have protein-based
organelles called bacterial microcompartments, which are protein shells that assemble around a group of
enzymes. Since microcompartments are essential for bacterial growth and pathogenesis, understanding the
mechanisms that control their assembly would provide information for developing novel antibiotics that work by
inhibiting microcompartment formation.
Assembly mechanisms inferred from experiments alone are incomplete because intermediates are transient and
thus not readily observed. Therefore, this project develops and applies computational models for capsid proteins,
nucleic acids (NAs), putative antiviral agents, and microcompartment components that reveal details of assembly
not accessible to experiments. The first aim will study how NAs guide assembly pathways toward particular
capsid structures. Goals will include understanding experiments in which capsid proteins form different
icosahedral morphologies to accommodate NAs with different physical properties (e.g. sequence length and
base-pairing interactions), and testing simulated pathways against experiments from collaborators. The latter
effort will include developing a computational tool to predict small angle x-ray scattering profiles from simulation
trajectories as well as developing models that interpret novel light scattering experiments that monitor assembly
of individual capsids. The second aim will examine how small molecules that perturb protein-protein or protein-
NA interactions redirect assembly pathways. The goal is to learn how to design optimal antiviral agents. We will
develop coarse-grained computational models that are informed by atomistic simulations and predict assembly
pathways and products as a function of the amount and type of putative antiviral agent. Predictions will be
compared against extensive data from our experimental collaborator on assembly of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
proteins in the presence of potential antiviral agents. Finally, the third aim will study how bacterial
microcompartments assemble around their enzyme cargos. The simulations will identify assembly pathways and
critical control parameters for microcompartment assembly, while learning how protein shell assembly can
promote and regulate liquid-liquid phase separation within cells.
To enable simulating the length and time scales of assembly, our simulations employ advanced GPU computing
and an approach to apply Markov state modeling to assembly reactions developed by our group. Furthermore,
we use coarse-grained models that are informed by experiments and atomistic simulations.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HAGAN, MICHAEL F</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM107023</grantId><grantName>Mechanisms of Biological Fluoride Resistance Exporters</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1125083.0</amount><startDate>2014-08-01</startDate><endDate>2019-07-31</endDate><keyword>protein sequence, Primary Protein Structure, Amino Acid Sequence, Anions, Miscellaneous Antibiotic, Antibiotic Drugs, Antibiotic Agents, Antibiotics, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, Bacteria, Behavior, biophysical sciences, biophysical principles, biophysical foundation, Biophysics, C.albicans, C. albicans, C albicans, Candida albicans, Transporter Protein, Transport Proteins, Transport Protein Gene, Carrier Proteins, Chemistry, Crystallization, Cytoplasm, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Environment, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, Exhibits, Family, alpha 2-Surface Binding Glycoprotein, Opsonic alpha(2)SB Glycoprotein, Opsonic Glycoprotein, Large External Transformation-Sensitive Protein, LETS Proteins, Fibronectin 1, FN1, Cold-Insoluble Globulins, Fibronectins, fluoridation, Water fluoridation, Fluorides, fungus, Gene Duplication, Genes, Genome, Glycolysis, Fab Immunoglobulins, Immunoglobulin, F(ab) Fragment, Fab Fragments, Antigen Binding Fragment, Ion Channel, Membrane Channels, Ionic Channels, Ions, Leishmania major, Leishmania tropica major, Leishmania (Leishmania) major, Light, Photoradiation, Membrane Proteins, Surface Proteins, Membrane-Associated Proteins, Membrane Protein Gene, Modernization, Movement, body movement, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mtb, M.tuberculosis, M.tb, M. tuberculosis, M. tb, M tuberculosis, M tb, Nucleic Acids, Oral health, dental health, Organism, living system, Proteins, Protons, Hydrogen Ions, H+ element, Protozoa, Protozoal, Research, Sea, Soil, Specificity, Employee Strikes, Strikes, Surveys, Survey Instrument, Testing, Time, Toxin, T. gondii, T gondii, Toxoplasma gondii, Twins, Twin Multiple Birth, vertebrata, Vertebrate Animals, Vertebrates, Work, Xrays, X-Rays Radiation, X-Rays, X-Radiation, Roentgen Rays, Xenobiotics, antiporter, Streptococcus enterococcus group, Enterococcus, falls, antiport, Ion Transport, Sequence Analyses, SEQ-AN, Sequence Analysis, base, improved, Variation, Variant, Biological, Biochemical, insight, data repository, Databanks, Data Bases, Data Banks, Databases, Chaperone, Molecular Chaperones, Biological Function, Biological Process, Dimerization, Protein Dimerization, Investigation, microorganism, dimer, Membrane, membrane structure, Membrane Transport Proteins, Membrane Transporters, stoichiometry, drinking water, protein transport, Protein Trafficking, Duplicate Genes, Toxic effect, Toxicities, Fluoride Ion, F- element, Structure, novel, member, Basic Science, Basic Research, Categories, Eukaryota, Eukaryote, Property, Pathogenicity, CLC Gene, CLC, BSF3, Homologous Gene, Homologue, Homolog, GeneHomolog, Protein Family, Affinity, Resolution, Phylogenetics, Phylogenetic Analysis, Molecular, pathogen, Coupled, Coupling, Resistance, resistant, vertebrate genome, reconstitution, reconstitute, public health relevance, Cone, experimental study, experimental research, experiment,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will subject two newly discovered families of F- -transporting membrane proteins to detailed functional and mechanistic scrutiny and will seek to solve their high-resolution crystal structures. These proteins expel F- from the cytoplasm to protect bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes from the toxic effects of ambient F- in the environment. The two protein families are phylogenetically unrelated. The "CLCF" exporters represent a clade within the long-studied CLC superfamily of anion channels and transporters, while the "Fluc" exporters are a previously unknown-function family of small membrane proteins. Our preliminary experiments have already uncovered for the CLCF exporters several surprising variations on mechanistic themes well-established for Cl- transport in "conventional" CLC proteins: (1) the absence of the anion- coordinating residues conserved among all previously studied CLCs, (2) an extremely high selectivity for F-, (3) a proton-coupled F- antiport mechanism despite a signature sequence suggesting that these would be ion channels, and (4) an unprecedented 1-to-1 anion/H+ exchange stoichiometry. For Fluc proteins, our work shows these to be highly F--selective ion channels. Sequence analysis argues strongly that the functional channel is an unusual "antiparallel oligomer," and our experimental results indicate unprecedented dimeric architecture in which the twin subunits are inserted into the membrane in opposite orientations. The project combines electrophysiological, membrane-biophysical, and structural analysis to attack fundamental questions arising from these results: what residues determine anion- selectivity and H+ movement in the CLCF antiporters? How must we modify accepted antiport mechanisms to account for the surprising 1-to-1 F-/H+ stoichiometry of CLCFs? Where are the pore-lining residues in Fluc channels and what accounts for their high anion selectivity? Answers to basic questions like these are necessary to bring into focus our view of how these membrane proteins work to export F- and thus counteract this ion's pervasive challenge to cellular integrity. Since these F- exporters are found in many bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens but not in vertebrates, they may provide novel antibiotic targets.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MILLER, CHRISTOPHER </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM105049</grantId><grantName>System Dynamics Modeling of Multi-level Coping Responses to Understand Resilience</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>763932.0</amount><startDate>2013-08-10</startDate><endDate>2018-04-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, senior citizen, over 65 Elderly, older person, older adult, later life, late life, geriatric, elders, advanced age, Aged 65 and Over, Elderly, Pain Therapy, Pain Control, Pain management, Behavior, Buffers, virtual simulation, in silico, computerized simulation, computerized modeling, computer based models, computational simulation, computational models, computational modeling, Mathematical Models and Simulations, Mathematical Model Simulation, Computerized Models, Computer based Simulation, Computer Models, Computer Simulation, computer methods, computational methods, computational methodology, Computing Methodologies, Crowding, Disasters, Elements, Exhibits, Feedback, Health, Hospitals, Methods, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, Morbidity, Morbidity - disease rate, Mortality, Mortality Vital Statistics, National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.), Patients, Pulmonary Inflammation, Pneumonitis, Pneumonia, Public Health, public health medicine (field), Public Policy, Research, Research Resources, Resources, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, sociobehavioral, sociobehavior, Social Behavior, Solutions, Testing, thoughts, Thinking, Thinking, function, adaptive behavior, adaptation behavior, Adaptive Behaviors, health care, Healthcare, Outcome Measure, Process Measure, Caring, Site, Acute, pediatric, Childhood, Individual, Policies, root, Plant Roots, Scientist, Complex, Source, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Services, Emergency room, Emergency Department, Accident and Emergency department, American, behavioral/social science, experience, Performance, Program Announcement, NIH Program Announcements, social, Modeling, QOC, Quality of Care, response, theories, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, model development, Provider, NIGMS, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Characteristics, Cardiac, developmental, Development, Behavioral, Healthcare professional, Health Care Professional, Health Professional, resilience, coping, Coupling, resistant, Resistance, public health relevance, operation, screening,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ED / hospital crowding is a major public health problem that leads to degradation in both  process and outcome measures across a wide range of health conditions, including acute  cardiac care, care for the elderly, pneumonia, pain management, pediatric care, and public  health screening.  The crowding problem is an example of complex social behavior that emerges from the interaction of individual elements (patients, providers, resources, policies, practices, health conditions, and others) of the system. The crowding problem has exhibited "policy resistance":  despite being a source of concern for 20 years, it continues worsen. Even more insidiously, many current proposed solutions may have feedbacks that exacerbate the problem in a vicious cycle.  Because of its dynamic complexity, delayed feedback loops, and social- behavioral components, the problem seems ideally suited to a system dynamics approach.  For example, a system dynamics understanding of crowding would be useful in the following ways:      
*	Developing early warning signals of and responses to a potential overcrowding crisis    
*	Identifying leverage points for managing dynamic and unexpected changes in patient demand or organizational capacity to respond    
*	Identifying potentially dysfunctional interventions to be avoided, i.e., that might provide   short term relief but ultimately make the overall problem worse.     
   
The broad, overall objective of this project is use system dynamics modeling to study the problem of emergency department (ED) and hospital crowding in order to develop theory and  inform departmental, organizational, regional, and societal policies and interventions aimed at alleviating it.     
A trans-disciplinary research team comprising scientists with expertise in the behavioral and  social sciences as well as in computational modeling and systems thinking will use a single  healthcare organization that has experienced severe crowding problems as a test site for the  model development. The team will construct system dynamic models of the ED - hospital crowding problem, tightly grounded in the individual and collective behavior of people in a focal ED. These models will focus on ordinary operations, i.e., not external disaster scenarios.  The models will study the ways in which crowded EDs experience perturbations to routine operations, how these perturbations occasion multi-level responses to cope and recover, and the role of resilience in the behavior of the system.  The models will be used for exploration and experimentation to identify characteristic behaviors, evaluate potential interventions, and identif leverage points and critical variables supporting resilient performance. The project aims to use the system dynamics models to develop theory to inform our understanding of how the ED, in the context of the broader healthcare and emergency response system, adapts to varying demands for service and the consequences of this adaptive behavior.  It would thus be most suitable for NIGMS as primary funder, with the NIMH as secondary.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MORRISON, BRADLEY </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM100966</grantId><grantName>Collaborative experimental &amp; computational studies of conformational transitions</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1222086.0</amount><startDate>2013-07-01</startDate><endDate>2019-02-28</endDate><keyword>Myokinase, Adenylokinase, ATP-AMP Transphosphorylase, ATP-AMP Phosphotransferase, AMP Kinase, adenylate kinase, aminoacid, Amino Acids, Behavior, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Biology, biophysical sciences, biophysical principles, biophysical foundation, Biophysics, Catalysis, computing method, computer methods, computational methods, computational methodology, Computing Methodologies, Disorder, Disease, Drug Design, Elements, Environment, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, E coli, Escherichia coli, Family, Grant, Health, Kinetics, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Photoradiation, Light, Methods, conformational state, conformation, Molecular Stereochemistry, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Conformation, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, living system, Organism, pressure, Protein Conformation, Proteins, Relaxation, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Temperature, Testing, Time, Water, Hydrogen Oxide, Measures, Mutagenesis, Mutagenesis Molecular Biology, Genetics-Mutagenesis, Point Mutation, protein folding, base, Series, Link, Individual, Cell Structure, Cell Components, Cellular Structures, enzyme activity, Shapes, Nature, Entropy, Knowledge, Complex, Dependence, System, meetings, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, molecular dynamics, mutant, Performance, Structure, simulation, novel, member, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Reporting, Modeling, Sampling, response, extreme temperature, Homologue, Homolog, GeneHomolog, Homologous Gene, Signaling Pathway Gene, Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene, Signaling Protein, protein structure, Data, ProteinHomolog, Protein Homolog, Homologous Protein, Resolution, Molecular, Process, protein function, pathway, Pathway interactions, computational studies, computer studies, designing, design, multidisciplinary, conformational conversion, conformational transition, flexibility, flexible, Drug Targeting,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein conformational transitions are fundamental to signaling, enzyme catalysis, and assembly of cellular structures. Developing a quantitative understanding of how proteins interconvert between different folded structures is a grand challenge in biology; meeting this challenge would have an impact in treating a large number of diseases that are linked to signaling cascades or enzymes.  This proposal aims to understand the physical principles that control protein conformational transitions by characterizing transitio pathways in proteins. Since these pathways are very complex, homologous proteins will be compared to make this aim feasible. We focus on a signaling proteins from the two-component system family (NtrC) and homologs of the enzyme adenylate kinase (Adk) from E. coli and extremophiles. These Adk homologs have optimal enzymatic activity at extreme temperature or pressure.  An iterative approach between NMR dynamics experiments, advanced computational methods and functional assays is proposed. (1) Structures of stable conformational states and rates of interconversion between them are measured experimentally, (2) transition pathways are computationally characterized in atomistic detail, (3) crucial interactions that facilitate pathway are identified, (4) mutations are designed that disable these interactions, (5) the resulting changes in interconversion rates are measured experimentally, and (6) new computations are performed based on experimental observations. By comparing transition pathways among homologous proteins and mutants key residues are identified that lead to mechanistic differences, and confer their respective temperature or pressure behaviors. Furthermore, determining interconversion entropy and entropy changes for these enzymes adapted to extreme environments may shed light on the evolutionary selection mechanisms that shaped primitive enzymes. In a broader context, knowledge gained from the molecular pathways may elucidate general principles of conformational transitions in proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of protein energy landscapes from the ground states to "transition landscapes".</description><investigator><investigatorId>HAGAN, MICHAEL F</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM100921</grantId><grantName>Inhibitor mediated protein degradation</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1212281.0</amount><startDate>2012-04-01</startDate><endDate>2017-01-31</endDate><keyword>inhibitor, inhibitor/antagonist, L-Isomer Arginine, L-Arginine, Arginine, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Carbamates, Cells, affinity purification, Affinity Chromatography, Elements, E coli, Escherichia coli, Edecrin, Ethacrynic Acid, glutathione aryltransferase, glutathione aralkyltransferase, S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase, Ligandins, Heme Transfer Protein, Glutathione Transferase, Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase, Glutathione S-Aryltransferase, Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase, Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase, Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase, EC 2.5.1.18, Glutathione S-Transferase, hereditary disorder, genetic disorder, Molecular Disease, Genetic Diseases, Genetic Condition, Hereditary Disease, Ligands, Methods, living system, Organism, Transphosphorylases, Kinases, EC 2.7, Phosphotransferases, gene product, Proteins, structure function relationship, chemical structure function, Structure-Activity Relationship, Technology, Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase, Folic Acid Reductase, EC 1.5.1.3, Dihydrofolate Dehydrogenase, Dihydrofolate Reductase, Trimpex, Proloprim, 2,4-Pyrimidinediamine, 5-((3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methyl)-, Trimethoprim, Work, Dissociation, Mediating, Fusion Protein, Chimera Protein, Chimeric Proteins, Biological, Proteosome, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Proteasome, Prosome, Multicatalytic Proteinase, Macroxyproteinase, Macropain, 20S Proteosome, 20S Proteasome, 20S Core Proteasome, 20S Catalytic Proteasome, multicatalytic endopeptidase complex, Link, Biological Function, Biological Process, tool, Investigation, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, SNAP, S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine, Regulatory Protein Degradation, Protein Turnover, Metabolic Protein Degradation, protein degradation, model organism, Animal Models and Related Studies, Animal Model, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Basic Research, Basic Science, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, anticancer therapy, Malignant Neoplasm Treatment, Malignant Neoplasm Therapy, Cancer Treatment, cancer therapy, drug discovery, protein expression, Pharmacological Substance, Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceutical Agent, Pharmacologic Substance, DNA Repair Enzymes, small molecule, DHFR, DHFR gene, Dasatinib, Affinity, Posttranslational Regulation, Post-Translational Regulation, translation research enterprise, translation research, Translational Science, Translational Research Enterprise, Translational Research, protein function, pathway, Pathway interactions, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies, Biocompatible, chemotherapy, effective treatment, effective therapy,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A formidable toolkit exists for manipulating protein expression at the transcriptional level, but the methods for the post-translational modulation of proteins are few and of limited utility.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to determine how both the dynamics and spatial organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are coordinated by a group of five interacting mammalian proteins: APC, Dia1, EB1, CLIP-170, and capping protein. This work will define the functions and mechanisms of these proteins in microtubule-actin cross-regulation, and will thereby provide a deeper understanding of the molecular activities and interactions that underlie such processes as cell migration, cell adhesion, and cell and tissue morphogenesis. This project uses bulk biochemical experiments combined with novel multi-wavelength single molecule fluorescence methods that we have tailored to directly observe the mechanisms of complex multi- component regulatory systems in vitro. Further, the mechanisms deduced from the experiments in vitro will be tested in vivo to confirm that they are important for specific cellular functions of these proteins. The Specific Aims are: (1) Test the hypothesis that the microtubule plus end-binding protein EB1 directly regulates nucleation of actin filaments by APC-Dia1; (2) Test the hypothesis that the rate and duration of actin filament elongation is controlled by dynamic binding interactions of Dia1, capping protein, microtubules, and/or EB1 at barbed ends; and (3) Define the roles of APC, Dia1, EB1, and CLIP-170 in controlling microtubule plus end dynamics and in triggering ultrafast actin polymerization from microtubule plus ends.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GOODE, BRUCE L</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM096053</grantId><grantName>Evolution of enzyme function, mechanism, dynamics, and structure viewed at atomic resolution</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2542531.28</amount><startDate>2011-07-01</startDate><endDate>2019-11-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Anthrax disease, Anthrax, Bacteroides, Biophysics, biophysical sciences, biophysical principles, biophysical foundation, Charge, Cryptosporidium, Engineering, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, genetic epistases, gene x gene interaction, epistatic relationship, Interaction Deviation, Epistatic Deviation, Epistasis, Genetic Epistasis, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, Evolution, Family, Fluorescence, Modern Man, Human, Kinetics, lactic acid dehydrogenase, NAD-Lactate Dehydrogenase, L-Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.27, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Plasmodium Infections, Paludism, Malaria, NAD-Malate Dehydrogenase, Malic Dehydrogenase, Malate Dehydrogenase, Malates, Maps, Metabolic Processes, Intermediary Metabolism, Metabolism, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, Modernization, enzyme complex, Multienzyme Complexes, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, living system, Organism, Oxosuccinates, Ketosuccinates, Oxaloacetates, Plasmodium, tyrosyl protein kinase, hydroxyaryl protein kinase, Tyrosylprotein Kinase, Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK, Tyrosine Kinase, Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK, Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor, Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8, EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase, EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase, Protein Tyrosine Kinase, Proteins, Flavimonas, Chrysemonas, Pseudomonas, Research, Specificity, Substrate Specificity, Testing, Time, Levotryptophan, L-Tryptophan, Tryptophan, Mutagenesis Molecular Biology, Genetics-Mutagenesis, Mutagenesis, Planets, catalyst, cofactor, Biological, Medical, Active Sites, X-Ray Crystallography, Xray Crystallography, X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography, X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography, X Ray Crystallographies, Single Crystal Diffraction, insight, Metabolic, Genetic, Life, Adopted, Distant, Reaction, System, chemical reaction, enzyme mechanism, enzyme structure, success, Structure, novel, member, Positioning Attribute, Position, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Biochemical Reaction, Enzymatic Reaction, Resolution, Enzyme Kinetics, Phylogenetic Analysis, Phylogenetics, Monitor, Molecular, Process, Pathway interactions, pathway, nanomachine, nano machine, design, designing, innovation, innovative, innovate, public health relevance, Drug Targeting, Grain, human pathogen,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   
Most biochemical reactions take from hundreds to billions of years to occur spontaneously. However, life depends on highly organized networks of catalyzed chemical reactions that proceed not only rapidly, but specifically and with high fidelity. Biological catalysts are enzymes complicated molecular nanomachines that massively accelerate reactions by positioning specific substrate molecules with such precision that they are compelled to react. The molecular mechanism by which an enzyme executes this remarkable feat involves an exquisitely orchestrated sequence of steps. The structures, mechanisms, and functions of enzymes are all products of millions of years of evolution. Yet despite their fundamental biological importance, we have only a rudimentary understanding of the atomistic basis of the evolutionary changes that create novel enzymes. In this project, we will fully elucidate, at an atomistic level of description, the biophysical principles that underlie the evolutionary changes in structure, dynamics, and mechanism producing novel enzymatic functions. We will resurrect entire evolutionary lineages of ancestral enzymes, solve their structures, characterize their dynamics, and determine their kinetic mechanisms, all correlated with the functional changes observed along these evolutionary trajectories. While we are aggressively pursuing multiple systems to maximize success, our main model system is the malate and lactate dehydrogenase (M/LDH) superfamily. Both enzymes are found in the core metabolism of nearly every organism on the planet. M/LDHs are homologous enzymes that share a fold and catalytic mechanism yet can possess extraordinarily strict specificity for their substrates. The evolution of this family is marked by many important functional innovations, including (1) sharp alterations in substrate specificity, (2) changes in catalytic rate, (3) gain of allosteric control by small effector molecues, (4) acquisition of thermophilic, cryophilic, halophilic, and alkalophilic stability, and (5) the evolution of multimerization via new protein-protein interfaces. Many of these novelties are convergent, having evolved several times independently. We aim to: 1) reveal the changes in enzyme structure and dynamics responsible for functional convergence; 2) characterize the evolution of the mechanisms of substrate specificity; and 3) resolve the correlated, epistatic mutations that determine enzyme function and specificity. How do substitutions far from the active site affect activity? What is the molecular basis of epistasis? Does specificity increase during evolution? Were the ancestors of M/LDHs promiscuous? By answering these questions, we will provide the first fine-grained description of how enzyme structures and kinetic mechanisms constrain and channel genetic evolutionary processes. The M/LDH superfamily is a classic, well-characterized system, with a common kinetic mechanism and cofactor. Hence, the resulting evolutionary insights will apply broadly to other enzymes and may transform our understanding of how enzymes can be rationally engineered.</description><investigator><investigatorId>THEOBALD, DOUGLAS LOWELL</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM094468</grantId><grantName>Bayesian analysis of structural shape and conformation</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1420402.0</amount><startDate>2010-08-05</startDate><endDate>2016-07-31</endDate><keyword>abstracting, Algorithms, protein sequence, Primary Protein Structure, Amino Acid Sequence, Communities, Elements, Evolution, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Least-Squares Analyses, Least Squares, Least-Squares Analysis, Libraries, Methods, statistical linear models, statistical linear mixed models, Probability Models, Probabilistic Models, Statistical Models, Structural Models, conformational state, conformation, Molecular Stereochemistry, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Conformation, Motion, Programming Languages, gene product, Proteins, Research, Skull, cranium, computer program/software, Software, Computer software, Solutions, Testing, Work, Measures, doubt, Uncertainty, protein folding, base, density, macromolecule, improved, Biological, psychological, psychologic, Pythons, Individual, Bayesian statistics, Bayesian statistical inference, Bayesian statistical analysis, Bayesian spatial analysis, Bayesian network analysis, Bayesian inference, Bayesian Analysis, Bayesian posterior distribution, Bayesian classification procedure, Bayesian classification method, Bayesian approaches, Bayesian Statistical Method, Bayesian Methodology, Bayesian Method, data repository, clinical data repository, Electronic Database, Electronic Databank, Databanks, Data Bases, Data Banks, Databases, Shapes, programs, Complex, Techniques, interest, structural biology, Structure, novel, Coding System, Code, Modeling, Sampling, theories, MRI Scans, Bio-Informatics, Bioinformatics, Data, ProteinHomolog, Protein Homolog, Homologous Protein, Molecular, developmental, Development, Source Code, website, web site, computational tools, computerized tools, public health relevance, Bayesian tracking algorithms, Bayesian statistical models, Bayesian spatial models, Bayesian spatial image models, Bayesian spatial data model, Bayesian nonparametric models, Bayesian network model, Bayesian hierarchical model, Bayesian framework, Bayesian belief updating model, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian adaptive models, Bayesian adaptive designs, Bayesian Modeling,</keyword><description>  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate analysis of structural differences and commonalities is of fundamental importance for understanding the structure, function, and evolution of biological macromolecules. For the past 40 years, structural analysis methods have relied on the biophysically unrealistic and restrictive least-squares criterion to find optimal superpositions. By developing probabilistic models of structural change that can take advantage of powerful maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian techniques, this proposed work will greatly expand our abilities to accurately superposition, align, and analyze structural conformations. The specific aims of this work are (1) to develop Bayesian models and theory for superpositioning structural conformation, (2) develop ML and Bayesian models and theory for multiple structure-based alignment, and (3) develop and distribute computational tools that implement this ML and Bayesian structural analysis. ML and Bayesian structural analysis will provide many distinct advantages over current least-squares and other ad hoc methods, including (1) straight- forward estimates of the uncertainty in the solutions of estimated parameters, (2) elegant handling of uncertainty in structural data, (3) natural incorporation of disparate types of prior structural and molecular information, (4) easy examination of complex models of structural change and evolution, (5) rigorous testing of complex structural hypotheses, and (6) natural handling of missing structural data. While we concentrate specifically on the conformations of macromolecules, the methods proposed herein have broad mathematical generality and will impact not only molecular structural biology but also an unusually wide range of scientific fields, including any that compare the shapes and conformations of objects. The results developed from this work will be applicable to any entity that can be represented as a set of Cartesian points in a multi-dimensional space, whether the particular structures under study are proteins, skulls, MRI scans, geological strata, or even psychological profiles of human individuals.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to determine how the assembly dynamics and architecture of the actin cytoskeleton are controlled by formins and the cellular mechanisms regulating their activities. We are studying this question in budding yeast, where formins assemble actin cables of a characteristic length, architecture, and dynamics required for polarized cell growth. Further, we extend this work to mammalian formin regulation. The proposal focuses on several new multi-component mechanisms discovered during the previous funding cycle, which control formin-mediated actin nucleation, or the duration and speed of formin-mediated actin filament elongation events. The project combines genetics, live- cell imaging, biochemistry, and novel multi-wavelength single molecule TIRF microscopy. The Aims are: (1) Test the hypothesis that formin-mediated actin cable nucleation is spatially and temporally controlled by the combinatorial effects of Bud6, profilin, Tpm1, and Tpm2; (2) Test the hypothesis that actin cable length, velocity, and architecture are controlled by dynamic interplay at filament barbed ends involving formins, Bud14-Kel1-Kel2 complex, capping protein, and Smy1; and (3) Test the hypothesis that human CLIP-170 interacts with mDia1 to form a novel barbed end- tracking complex that supports ultrafast actin filament elongation in vitro and in vivo.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GOODE, BRUCE L</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM081648</grantId><grantName>Single-molecule visualization of transcription regulation mechanisms</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5821024.74</amount><startDate>2007-07-15</startDate><endDate>2024-02-29</endDate><keyword>Affect, Bacteria, Combining Site, Reactive Site, Binding Sites, Biology, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Malignant Neoplasms, Cell Differentiation, Cell Differentiation process, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cell physiology, Cell Body, Cells, Color, Infectious Disease Pathway, Infectious Diseases, Infectious Disorder, Communicable Diseases, Complement Proteins, Complement, Disease, Disorder, DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, Saccharomycetales, Budding Yeast, Endomycetales, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Escherichia coli, E coli, E. coli, Fluorescent Dyes, Fluorescence Agents, Fluorescent Agents, fluorescent dye/probe, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Action Regulation, Gene Regulation, Gene Regulation Process, Genes, Regulator Genes, Transcriptional Regulatory Elements, regulatory gene, trans acting element, Goals, In Vitro, Kinetics, Fluorescence Microscopy, Fluorescence Light Microscopy, Molecular Conformation, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Stereochemistry, conformation, conformational, conformational state, conformationally, conformations, Nuclear Proteins, Nucleic Acids, Organism, living system, Proteins, Public Health, Repression, Research, Ribosomes, RNA, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA Polymerase II, DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II, RNA Polymerase B, DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase, DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases, RNA Polymerases, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Baker's Yeast, Brewer's Yeast, S cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae, Spectroscopy, Spectrum Analyses, Spectrum Analysis, Testing, Time, Basal Transcription Factor, Basal transcription factor genes, General Transcription Factor Gene, General Transcription Factors, Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene, Transcription factor genes, transcription factor, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Translating, translation, Translations, Virulence, Work, Yeasts, Elongation Factor, bases, base, improved, Site, Chemicals, Stimulus, Individual, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, Binding Proteins, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, Knowledge, Life, programs, Complex, Reaction, Pattern, System, brain cell, molecular dynamics, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Speed, Structure, Human Biology, Eukaryota, Eukaryote, genetic regulatory protein, Regulatory Protein, regulatory gene product, Regulation, Modeling, Property, single molecule, Genomics, Transcriptional Regulation, Transcription Regulation, Transcriptional Control, Transcription Initiation, Binding, Molecular Interaction, protein complex, Normal Cell, RNA chemical synthesis, RNA synthesis, Polymerase, Small RNA, Length, Data, Transcription Elongation, Transcript, Monitor, Molecular, Process, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, Population, Coupling, reconstitution, reconstitute, combat, study population, recruit, human pathogen, Visualization,</keyword><description>Project Summary
 A central concern of the present post-genomic era of biology is understanding the chemical and physical
mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated. Appropriate activation and repression of particular genes
is necessary for maintaining normal cell function and is required for executing the programs of cell
differentiation that are essential to the development of multicellular organisms. Collectively, gene regulatory
systems are the “molecular brain” of the cell that allow it to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli.
Many cancers and other diseases result from deranged gene regulation.
 In this research project, we have developed and applied a powerful approach to quantitatively defining the
dynamic molecular mechanisms of transcription and transcription regulation in vitro. Instead of studying
populations of molecules, we directly visualize the RNA polymerase and associated regulatory proteins on
isolated single DNA molecules, following the progression of the molecular machinery through its different
states in real time while simultaneously observing the transcription reaction itself. Such direct visualization is
made possible by a multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approach we call CoSMoS
(colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy). In this application, we propose applying the CoSMoS approach
to elucidating the dynamic mechanisms of selected processes involved in regulation of transcription initiation
and elongation using both bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases and regulatory proteins in transcription
reactions in vitro. Our goals are: 1) Reveal how two different secondary channel binding proteins exert their
regulatory functions through a single shared target site on RNA polymerase. 2) Elucidate the mechanisms by
which bacterial elongation complexes are loaded with and regulated by general elongation factors NusA and
NusG. 3) Reveal recruitment and competition within sets of general elongation factors in yeast RNA
polymerase II elongation complexes.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GELLES, JEFF </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM081639</grantId><grantName>Molecular and neuronal mechanisms of thermosensory behavior</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2339822.0</amount><startDate>2007-09-01</startDate><endDate>2017-10-31</endDate><keyword>Animals, Behavior, behavioral disorder, Behavior Disorders, Nucleus, Cell Nucleus, Communication, Cues, Environment, Exhibits, Food, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulation Process, Gene Regulation, Gene Action Regulation, Genes, Goals, ontogeny, Tissue Growth, Generalized Growth, Growth, guanosine 3'5' monophosphate, cGMP, Guanosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate), Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate, Guanosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate, Cyclic GMP, guanylyl cyclase, Inosinate Cyclase, Guanyl Cyclase, GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), Deoxyguanylate Cyclase, Guanylate Cyclase, Learning Disorders, Memory, Model System, Biologic Models, Biological Models, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, neuroplasticity, neural plasticity, CNS plasticity, Neuronal Plasticity, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, Neuropeptides, living system, Organism, Transphosphorylases, Kinases, EC 2.7, Phosphotransferases, Plastics, Play, social role, Role, Signal Pathway, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Starvation, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Temperature, Testing, Time, Translating, Work, Relative, Relative (related person), adaptive behavior, adaptation behavior, Adaptive Behaviors, Mediating, C.elegans, C elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans, base, Biochemical, Ensure, insight, Stimulus, Measurement, Funding, calcium-dependent CaM kinase I, CaM kinase I, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, Therapeutic, Knowledge, long term memory, Complex, Sensory, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Nuclear, Formulation, Drug Formulations, experience, adult animal, mature animal, Receptor Protein, receptor, neuromodulation, neural regulation, neural control, neuroregulation, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, protein kinase II, microtubule associated protein 2 kinase, calmodulin dependent protein kinase, calcium-calmodulin-dependent PK type II, calcium-calmodulin-dependent PK, CaMK, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, neural circuit, response, developmental disorder, developmental disease/disorder, Sensory Process, Address, Data, Molecular, Process, Behavioral, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, Behavioral Assay, neural mechanism, neuromechanism, flexible, flexibility, optogenetics, in vivo imaging,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major role of the nervous system is to sense and integrate external and internal cues in the context of past experience and current conditions, and translate this information into behavioral outputs. The intracellular and intercellular signaling pathways by which neuronal networks generate defined, yet adaptive behaviors are not well understood. The study of thermosensory behaviors in C. elegans provides an excellent system in which to explore the pathways by which a small, hard-wired neuronal network generates highly complex and experience-dependent behaviors. The behavior of C. elegans on a thermal gradient is governed by a 'memory' of its cultivation temperature (Tc), such that animals exhibit defined behaviors in specific temperature ranges relative to Tc. Tc memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation of animals at a new temperature. The overall goal of this proposal is to describe the mechanisms by which sensory transduction, plasticity and communication among thermosensory neurons generate robust, yet flexible behaviors in an experience- and context-dependent manner. The Specific Aims are to:  1) Examine the role of CaMKI/IV-mediated regulation of gene expression in setting Tc memory in the AFD thermosensory neurons. Tc memory is in part encoded by the response threshold of the AFD thermosensory neurons. This aim will test the hypothesis that activity-regulated changes in the expression of AFD-expressed signaling genes sets their response threshold, and that these changes are mediated by a CaMKI/IV cascade.  2) Explore the role of neuromodulation in setting the operating range of the ASI thermosensory neurons. Although AFD was the only previously known thermosensory neuron type, we have now shown that the ASI sensory neurons are also thermosensory, and exhibit a Tc-dependent operating range. The operating range of ASI may be set by AFD via peptidergic neuromodulation. This aim will utilize highly quantitative behavioral assays, in vivo imaging, and optogenetic manipulations to describe the mechanisms by which AFD signals to ASI to coordinate their response ranges.  3) Investigate mechanisms of thermotransduction and plasticity in the AWC thermosensory neurons. In addition to AFD and ASI, we showed that the AWC olfactory neurons are also thermosensory. The goal of this aim is to define molecular mechanisms of thermotransduction in AWC, and to explore the hypothesis that AWC represents the locus of starvation-induced behavioral plasticity in the circuit.  Work from our lab has uncovered unexpected complexity in thermosensory processing at the periphery. The proposed experiments will elucidate the mechanisms by which coordination and communication among multiple thermosensory neuron types ensures a coherent behavioral output. Given the remarkable conservation of signaling pathways, synaptic mechanisms and circuit functions across species, this work will provide new information about sensory processing and plasticity in more complex nervous systems.</description><investigator><investigatorId>SENGUPTA, PIALI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM076020</grantId><grantName>Analysis of Break-Induced Replication</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2907951.0</amount><startDate>2006-08-01</startDate><endDate>2019-07-31</endDate><keyword>Attention, bacterial virus, Phages, Bacteriophages, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, neoplasm/cancer, malignancy, Malignant Tumor, Cancers, Malignant Neoplasms, Chromosomes, Disorder, Disease, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, DNA, Unscheduled DNA Synthesis, DNA Damage Repair, DNA Repair, Endomycetales, Budding Yeast, Saccharomycetales, endonuclease, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, Gene Conversion, Gene Fusion, Goals, Modern Man, Human, Introns, Intervening Sequences, Laboratories, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Learning, Maintenance, Methods, Biological Models, Model System, Biologic Models, Play, Proteins, Genetic Recombination, Recombination, DNA Recombination, Role, social role, Work, telomere, Mediating, Telomerase, Homologous Sequences, Sequence Homologs, DNA analysis, Site, repair, repaired, Variation, Variant, pediatric, Childhood, Gene Targeting, Collaborations, RAD51 protein, Rad51 recombinase, Chromosomal Breaks, Chromosome Break, Event, Distant, Location, Loss of Heterozygosity, Allelic Loss, Ablation, experience, DNA biosynthesis, DNA Synthesis, DNA Replication, DNA replication fork, replication fork, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, novel, Chromosome Structures, Chromosome Organization, Chromosomal Structure, Chromosomal Organization, developmental disease/disorder, developmental disorder, Mismatch Repair, Post-Replication Mismatch Repair, recombinational repair, Recombination Repair, Homologous Recombinational Repair, Genome Stability, Genomic Stability, Replication-Associated Process, Replication Process, Monitor, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, Outcome, Coupled, human disease, gene repair, public health relevance, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR, chromothripsis, DNA sequencing, DNAseq, DNA seq,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Summary The repair of broken chromosomes is essential for maintenance of chromosome structure and genome stability. This proposal focuses on delineating the mechanisms of repair of double-strand chromosome breaks (DSBs) by break-induced replication (BIR). BIR plays a key role in restarting stalled and broken DNA replication forks, in maintaining telomeres in the absence of the telomerase enzyme and in the newly discovered phenomenon of single chromosome shattering, known as chromothripsis, which is associated with human cancers and developmental diseases. A microhomology-mediated BIR (MM-BIR) process has been hypothesized to account for long-distance template switching events that lead to the joining of distant sequences to create novel gene fusions. Previous work from this laboratory has identified roles for replication proteins Pol32 and PCNA that are essential for BIR but not for normal replication or other types of DSB repair in the model organism, budding yeast. The proposed project to continue this study will focus on two main topics. First, the molecular mechanism of BIR will be pursued, creating site-specific DSBs by an inducible endonuclease. A novel assay has been developed to study surprisingly frequent template jumps during BIR both between homologous sequences in distant locations or between homeologous sequences (highly mismatched sequences that permit study of MM-BIR). This assay permits one to distinguish between the way in which a broken DNA end locates and recombines with a distant sequence by strand invasion and how the subsequent replicating strands in BIR then can jump to a third location. The role of mismatch repair proteins in discouraging BIR between diverged sequences will be investigated. Evidence that template jumping uses a different mechanism from the initial strand invasion step will be pursued. The possibility that the jump does not require the Rad51 recombinase protein will be explored. Special attention will be devoted to the role of Rdh54, the first protein that is specifically required for template jumps but competent for
simple BIR and other recombination events. Whether repair of a broken replication fork, created by nicking a specific strand with a CRISPR endonuclease, obeys the same rules as the ectopic model systems and telomere-repair events that have so far been studied is a fundamentally important question. A second major goal will be to examine translocations and rearrangements in which there is little or no homology at the repair junctions. A novel assay involving creation o a functional intron by joining distant sequences will be used. Finally, template jumps into unrelated sequences will be recovered and analyzed by DNA sequencing in order to better define how much homology and adjacent homeology is required for microhomology-mediated events. These studies are highly significant in understanding the origins of chromosome rearrangements associated with human disease, including the loss of heterozygosity caused by the formation of nonreciprocal translocations, segmental duplications and the astonishing rearrangements in chromosomes experiencing chromothripsis.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HABER, JAMES E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM063691</grantId><grantName>Mechanisms of actin filament remodeling and disassembly</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5917065.64</amount><startDate>2002-05-01</startDate><endDate>2021-04-30</endDate><keyword>Actins, Alleles, Allelomorphs, Alzheimer's Disease, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Architecture, Engineering / Architecture, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, malignant breast neoplasm, malignant breast tumor, Breast Cancer, Motility, Cellular Motility, Cellular Migration, Cell Movement, Cell Migration, Cell Locomotion, cell motility, Cell Body, Cells, Cognition, intracellular skeleton, Cytoskeletal System, Cellular Matrix, Cytoskeleton, Disorder, Disease, Endocytosis, Foundations, Goals, Grant, Health, Modern Man, Human, In Vitro, Learning, Listeria, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, COPD, Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease, Reticulolymphosarcoma, Malignant Lymphoma, Germinoblastoma, Germinoblastic Sarcoma, Lymphoma, Memory, Myofilaments, Actin Filaments, Microfilaments, Organelles, Proteins, Research, social role, Role, Solubility, Tail, Testing, Tropomyosin, Vacuole, Work, Yeasts, cofilin, singed protein, singed gene product, retinal fascin, FSCN2 gene product, fascin, Fimbrin, Glial Maturation Factor, GMF, Glia Maturation Factor, Mediating, coronin, Crnlp protein, coronin protein, base, Specific qualifier value, Specified, Physiological, Physiologic, Biochemical, Link, insight, Individual, Funding, Biological Process, Biological Function, depolymerization, Genetic, Cellular biology, cell biology, Complex, Side, Slide, 3-Dimensional, 3D, 3-D, mutant, Protein Isoforms, Isoforms, Intracellular Transport, Filopodia, Structure, novel, genetic regulatory protein, regulatory gene product, Regulatory Protein, Regulation, Modeling, single molecule, Transport Vesicles, Stress Fibers, alpha Actinin, α-Actinin, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Filamentous Actin, F-Actin, Thickness, Thick, Length, Biological Testing, Immunodeficiency and Cancer, Mammalian Cell, in vivo, Filament, Vesicle Transport Pathway, vesicular transport, vesicle transport, Characteristics, Molecular, protein function, Image, imaging, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy, TIRF Microscopy, design, designing, pathogen, human disease, comparative, protein crosslink, in vitro testing, Geometry, network architecture, live cell imaging, live cellular imaging, live cellular image, live cell image, imaging approach, imaging based approach, in vivo evaluation, in vivo testing,</keyword><description>The goal of this research is to determine how the disassembly, turnover, and resculpting of cellular
actin filament arrays is regulated by the concerted actions of GMF, Coronin, Srv2/CAP, Twinfilin, Abp1,
Cofilin, and AIP1. Each of these core components of the eukaryotic actin machinery is conserved from
yeast to humans and has been genetically implicated in promoting actin turnover and remodeling.
However, the specific roles and mechanisms of each protein and how they function in groups are only
beginning to be understood. The proposed research will elucidate how these factors interact and work
together in novel multi-component mechanisms to control actin filament debranching, coalescence,
severing, capping, and depolymerization. This will define the molecular basis of diverse biological
processes that rely on characteristic actin network geometries and turnover rates, including cell motility,
endocytosis, and intracellular transport of vesicles, organelles, and pathogens. To achieve these goals,
we will combine genetics, biochemical assays, in vitro multi-wavelength single molecule TIRF
microscopy, and live cell imaging approaches. Mechanisms elucidated at the single molecule level in
vitro will be tested in vivo using separation-of-function alleles for their importance in diverse biological
processes. These include: yeast endocytosis and endosomal fusion with vacuoles, yeast actin cable
turnover mediating intracellular transport, actin-based motility of Listeria in infected mammalian cells,
and turnover of filopodia, stress fibers, and leading edge networks in mammalian cells. The Aims are:
(1) Test the hypothesis that actin filament networks are collaboratively debranched by mechanisms
involving GMF, Coronin, Cofilin, and Srv2/CAP. (2) Test the hypothesis that Srv2/CAP and Abp1
interact to form a megadalton-sized complex that remodels actin networks by a novel mechanism of

In budding yeast, creation of a single DSB is sufficient to activate the Mec1 (ATR) and Tel1 (ATM) checkpoint protein kinases that both modify chromatin around the DSB and trigger a cascade of phosphorylations that result in the arrest of cell cycle progression prior to anaphase. This proposal investigates three major aspects of the checkpoint response: the activation and maintenance of the checkpoint, the modification of chromatin by formation of g-H2AX and - as we have discovered - g-H2B, and a synergistic interaction of the DDR with the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint that is responsible for the prolongation of the arrested state. In the first Aim, how Mec1-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest is maintained will be investigated by studying newly-discovered mutations of phosphorylation sites on Mec1 that are required to turn the checkpoint off; consequently cells fail to adapt and resume mitosis after 12-15 h when there is no DSB repair. How Mec1 monitors the presence of DNA damage will be examined, focusing on the relation between 5' to 3' resection of the DSB ends by exonucleases and maintenance of the checkpoint. Previous results suggest that the ability of cells to resume cell cycle progression after a DSB is repaired depends on how long cells have been arrested, which may correlate with the strength of the checkpoint signal. The strength of checkpoint signaling will be examined by augmenting the response by artificially tethering the Ddc1 and Ddc2 (ATRIP) activators of Mec1 to elicit a response independent of a DSB. A second Aim will focus on the Mec1- and Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminus of histone H2B (g-H2B) that resembles the well-studied g- H2AX modification but appears to have separate roles in DNA damage signaling and repair. A third Aim will focus on the synergy between the DNA damage checkpoint and the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, following up our findings that deleting Mad2 shortens checkpoint arrest in wild type cells and suppresses the permanent arrest of adaptation-defective mutations and that this suppression can be mimicked by deleting the centromere on the chromosome suffering an unrepaired DSB.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HABER, JAMES E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM061591</grantId><grantName>Catalytic Umpolung Reactions of Imines</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3632924.0</amount><startDate>2000-07-01</startDate><endDate>2018-11-30</endDate><keyword>Amines, amine, Ammonium, Biological Response Modifier Therapy, biotherapy, biotherapeutics, biological treatment, biological therapeutic, Biological Therapy, Biologic Therapy, Biomedical Research, Carbon, Catalysis, Cinchona Alkaloids, Foundations, Goals, Imines, Methods, Nitrogen, N2 element, N element, Optics, optical, Play, Public Health, Research, Research Personnel, Researchers, Investigators, Role, social role, Sodium Chloride, salt, Work, catalyst, base, Phase, Biological, Series, insight, Funding, Therapeutic, Therapeutic Agents, tool, programs, Reaction, interest, nucleophilic addition, deprotonation, Structure, novel, Property, Pharmacologic Substance, Pharmacological Substance, Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceutical Agent, small molecule, Scheme, Process, Modification, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, designing, design, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies, cost-effective, cost effective, public health relevance, invention, Natural Products,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nitrogen-substituted carbon stereocenters are widely presented in numerous biologically active small molecules and pharmaceuticals. Thus, chiral amines are fundamentally important building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Building on a wealth of promising leads and insights revealed in recent preliminary studies, the proposed studies focus on the design and discovery of novel chiral phase transfer catalysts of new activity and selectivity for the development of a series of asymmetric imine umpolung reactions to directly transform prochiral simple and trifluoromethylated imines into the corresponding optically active chiral amines. In contrast to conventional nucleophilic addition reactions where imines serve as an electrophile, these new reactions utilize chiral organocatalysts to activate trifluoromethyl imines and simple imines as nucleophiles to form C-C bonds with a broad range of electrophile to enantioselectively generate the corresponding chiral amines. With a catalyst-induced reversal of the polarity in the reactivity of imines, these reactions are termed as catalytic asymmetric imine umpolung reactions. The specific aims are: 1)The discovery and development of novel chiral organocatalysts for asymmetric imine umpolung reactions.; 2) The development of C-C bond forming catalytic asymmetric imine umpolung reactions for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated amines; 3) The development of C-C bond forming catalytic asymmetric imine umpolung reactions for the asymmetric synthesis of unfunctionalized chiral amines. These catalytic asymmetric imine umpolung reactions allow novel bond disconnections for retrosynthetic design and consequently provide a fundamentally new approach toward chiral amino compounds.</description><investigator><investigatorId>DENG, LI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM054408</grantId><grantName>Neurochemistry and Genetics of Drosophila CaMKII</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2529847.0</amount><startDate>1996-05-01</startDate><endDate>2015-04-30</endDate><keyword>adulthood, adult human (21+), Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Affect, Alternative RNA Splicing, Alternate Splicing, Alternative Splicing, Animals, Axon, Behavior, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, cDNA, Complementary DNA, Factor IV, Coagulation Factor IV, Ca++ element, Blood Coagulation Factor IV, Calcium, Cells, Dendrites, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Drug Design, Ethers, Gene Expression, Genes, Goals, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, In Vitro, Membrane Channels, Ionic Channels, Ion Channel, Ions, Kinetics, Transmembrane Potentials, Resting Potentials, Membrane Potentials, conformational state, conformation, Molecular Stereochemistry, Molecular Configuration, Molecular Conformation, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, neurochemical, neurochemistry, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Protein Phosphorylation, Phosphorylation, Transphosphorylases, Kinases, EC 2.7, Phosphotransferases, Potassium Ion Channels, K channel, Potassium Channel, Protein Binding, gene product, Proteins, mRNA, Messenger RNA, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Solutions, Mass Spectrum Analyses, Mass Spectrum, Mass Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis, Mass Spectrum Analysis, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, Work, Measures, RNA, Messenger, Editing, RNA Editing, Sequence Analyses, SEQ-AN, Sequence Analysis, density, Site, Area, Biochemical, insight, Individual, Metabolic Networks, Biochemical Pathway, calcium-dependent CaM kinase II, CaMKII, CaM kinase II, CaM PK II, CaM KII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Transgenes, Genetic, scaffolding, scaffold, Complex, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Location, membrane structure, Membrane, mutant, homologous recombination, transgenic, Transgenic Organisms, Structure, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Intracellular Structure, Subcellular structure, Macromolecular Protein Complexes, Multiprotein Complexes, intervention therapy, Therapeutic Intervention, Voltage-Gated K+ Channels, Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel, Regulation, response, gene expression microarray, GeneChip, Gene Expression Chip, Gene Chips, Splice Donor Sites, 5' Splice Site, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNAi, RNA Silencing, Quelling, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, RNA Interference, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Binding (Molecular Function), preventing, prevent, Signaling Protein, Address, Affinity, Enzymatic Reaction, Biochemical Reaction, Motor, Mutate, in vivo, Knock-in, Knock-in Mouse, Scaffolding Protein, Molecular, Knockout, Knock-out, Process, Modification, Behavioral, Flies, fly, Output, deep sequencing, Motor output, Synaptic plasticity, C-terminal, postsynaptic, information processing, public health relevance, Drug Targeting,</keyword><description>  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The computational power of the nervous system relies on the ability of individual cells to integrate multiple inputs and generate an output targeted to the appropriate partner(s). These functions would be impossible without the asymmetric localization of proteins within the cell. For example, many of the proteins that are in the axon are specialized for functions like transport and electrical conduction. In contrast, many of the proteins in the dendrites are specialized for receiving information from other cells.  Restriction of localization is important for limiting the activity of a particular protein to a specific cellular compartment, but it can also be an important regulator of biochemical reactions. Many proteins behave differently when localized to a multiprotein complex due to the ability of direct binding partners to alter their conformation. This function of localization has important implications for how neurons process information that is relevant to many therapeutic interventions since it means that the behavior or activity of a protein cannot always be predicted from in vitro studies. This proposal has the goal of understanding how CaMKII and two proteins that directly bind to it, dCASK, a scaffold protein, and Eag, a potassium channel, are regulated by localization and cellular context.  To achieve an understanding of how cellular context can influence the activity of these proteins we propose two sets of experiments. In Aim #1 we will use a transfected cell system to understand how dCASK and CaMKII interact to change the location, activity and potential substrates of CaMKII in response to calcium influx. We will do a parallel set of experiments in dCASK mutant transgenic flies that express a YFP tagged dCASK transgene that restores normal behavior. We will determine where in the cell dCASK has to reside and what proteins it has to complex with to carry out its behavioral function.  Aim #2 addresses how Eag, a voltage-gated potassium channel, is localized and regulated by other proteins that bind to it. We have discovered a novel role for RNA editing in localization that has implications for many other genes that undergo this type of modification. We will also investigate the function of an alternative splice product of the eag gene that does not conduct ions, but instead functions as a scaffold for CaMKII and other signaling proteins. We address these issues by using homologous recombination to create mutations in the eag gene that selectively alter each of these processes and assess the impact on neuronal gene expression, excitability and behavior.

This situation limits the ability to design drugs, predict drug metabolism, toxicity and resistance, make functional assignments from protein sequence, and construct novel enzymes de novo. Clearly a deeper understanding of how proteins with similar structures recognize different substrates and/or catalyze different chemical transformations is required. The ultimate manifestation of such understanding would be computational models that accurately predict function.  Although remarkable advances have occurred in recent years, computational models of enzyme reactions are at best rudimentary. New computational methods are required. Progress demands the iterative deployment of new computational methods and detailed experimental characterization, which in turn requires close collaboration of computational and experimental scientists. This project proposes such a collaboration to develop computational models that accurately recapitulate and quantitatively predict the catalytic properties of proteins in the IMPDH/GMPR family. These enzymes have similar catalytic machinery, bind the same ligands with similar affinities, and react to form the same covalent intermediate, yet with very different outcomes. IMPDH catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) with the concomitant reduction of NAD+. This reaction controls the entry of purines into the guanine nucleotide pool, which in turn controls proliferation, making IMPDH a billion-dollar target for immunosuppressive and cancer chemotherapy. GMPR catalyzes the complimentary reduction of GMP to IMP and ammonia with concomitant oxidation of NADPH. The IMPDH reaction involves hydride transfer followed by hydrolysis while GMPR involves deamination followed by hydride transfer. How can a single active site accommodate multiple transition states? IMPDH solves this problem by rearranging its active site while GMPR uses two different cofactor conformations. Thus this project will require computational models of multiple chemical transformations with the accompanying conformational changes. The specific aims are:  Aim 1. Develop a computational model for hydride transfer and test experimentally.  Aim 2. Develop a computational model for the deamination reaction of GMPR and test experimentally.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HEDSTROM, LIZBETH K.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01GM051753</grantId><grantName>Replication Fork Repair</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>6780415.0</amount><startDate>1994-08-01</startDate><endDate>2026-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Aging, inhibitor, Bacteria, Malignant Neoplasms, Cancers, Malignant Tumor, malignancy, neoplasm/cancer, Cell Survival, Cell Viability, Cells, Cell Body, Conflict (Psychology), Conflict, Copying Processes, Duplicating Processes, DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, DNA Damage, DNA Injury, DNA Polymerase III, DNA Polymerase delta, DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase III, Pol III, DNA Repair, DNA Damage Repair, Unscheduled DNA Synthesis, Escherichia coli, E coli, E. coli, Evolution, Genes, Biochemical Genetics, Genome, Goals, Gram-Negative Bacteria, Growth, Generalized Growth, Tissue Growth, ontogeny, Head, Human, Modern Man, Infection, Molecular Biology, DNA Molecular Biology, Mutation, Genetic Alteration, Genetic Change, Genetic defect, genome mutation, Nucleotides, living system, Organism, Physiology, Play, Production, Proteins, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA, DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases, RNA Polymerases, DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase, rRNA, Ribosomal RNA, social role, Role, rRNA Operon, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Starvation, Testing, Toxin, Genetic Transcription, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Work, rho, Antibiotic Resistance, Resistance to antibiotics, Resistant to antibiotics, antibiotic drug resistance, antibiotic resistant, Mediating, Left, Site, Microscopic, repaired, repair, Biochemical, Neurologic, Neurological, Ensure, Premature Aging, Premature aging syndrome, Ligand Binding Protein, Ligand Binding Protein Gene, Protein Binding, bound protein, Binding Proteins, Holoenzymes, Genetic, Complex, Genetic Materials, Event, Reaction, microorganism, System, Clampings, Closure by clamp, interest, mutant, transcription termination, DNA Replication, DNA Synthesis, DNA biosynthesis, replication fork, DNA replication fork, cold shock protein, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, model organism, Animal Model, microbial, Base Pairing, Structure, novel, Genetic analyses, genetic analysis, Property, response, Genomic Instability, Genome Instability, helicase, DNA Helicases, DNA Unwinding Proteins, DNA unwinding enzyme, Pathogenicity Factors, Virulence Factors, Transcription Regulation, Transcriptional Control, Transcriptional Regulation, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Coenzyme Q-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Coenzyme QH2-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Complex III, Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase, Dihydroubiquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase, QH(2)-Cytochrome-c Reductase, QH(2)-Ferricytochrome-c Oxidoreductase, Ubihydroquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Ubiquinol-ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase, Ubiquinone-Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase, Electron Transport Complex III, protein complex, Genomic Stability, Genome Stability, preventing, prevent, Transcription Activator, Transcription Factor Coactivator, Transcriptional Activator, Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator, Transcriptional Coactivator, transcription co-activator, transcriptional co-activator, Transcription Coactivator, Bacteria KatF protein, Bacteria rpoS protein, Bacteria sigma factor 38 protein, Bacteria sigma factor S protein, RpoS, sigma(38) protein, Bacteria, sigma(S) protein, Bacteria, Bacteria sigma factor KatF protein, Address, Defect, Interruption, Proliferating, Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry, Protein Biochemistry, Regulatory Pathway, Transcript, infectious disease treatment, Immunologics, Immunochemical Immunologic, Immunologic, Immunological, Immunologically, Process, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, pathogenic bacteria, bacteria pathogen, bacterial pathogen, Genomic DNA, gDNA, genetic approach, genetic strategy, recruit, Genetic Diseases, genetic condition, genetic disorder, pathogenic microbe, microbe pathogen, microbial pathogen, Visualization, DNA metabolism,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Replication fork repair is essential for cell survival and stability of genetic material. In humans,
inefficiency of repair is associated with cancer proneness, neurological, immunological,
developmental defects and premature aging. For microbial pathogens, the ability to repair DNA
damage is required for survival of bacterial pathogens and promotes genetic change that can
contribute to antibiotic resistance and persistence of infection.
The long-term goal of our studies is a more complete mechanistic understanding of the repair of
replication forks and how it affects genomic stability. This will be accomplished using the genetic
system of Escherichia coli, whose physiology is well understood. A central interest is how
bacterial cells signal difficulties in replication to facilitate repair and how this is integrated with
other aspects of bacterial growth. By biochemical and genetic analysis, this work will elucidate
how a newly discovered conserved DNA helicase protein, YoaA, interacts with the replisome to
overcome barriers in replication. This study will specifically address the influence of RNA
transcription and DNA protein complexes on replication and genomic instability and what
mechanisms are used to overcome conflicts between replication and transcription machinery.
The regulatory pathway controlled by stringent starvation protein, SspA, will also be explored to
discover how it impacts DNA metabolism.
Because all cells repair DNA in fundamentally similar ways by evolutionarily related pathways,
these studies using microbial model organisms should reveal mechanisms applicable to repair
of DNA in human cells. In addition, because the DNA damage response in microbial pathogens
plays a role in toxin production, antibiotic resistance and persistence of infection, this work could
provide new information important for the treatment of infectious disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LOVETT, SUSAN THOMAS</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01EY025613</grantId><grantName>Gating of Firing Rate Homeostasis by Sleep and Wake States During Experience-Dependent Plasticity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2759524.88</amount><startDate>2017-09-01</startDate><endDate>2026-04-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Amblyopia, Animals, Arousal, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Eye, Eyeball, Gryllidae, Crickets, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Human, Modern Man, Influentials, Learning, permissiveness, Physiology, Rodent, Rodentia, Rodents Mammals, Role, social role, Sleep, Primary visual cortex, Striate Cortex, Striate area, area striata, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Testing, Sight, visual function, Vision, Diminished Vision, Low Vision, Partial Sight, Reduced Vision, Subnormal Vision, vision impairment, visually impaired, Visual impairment, visual cortical, Visual Cortex, Work, segregation, homotypical cortex, isocortex, neopallium, Neocortex, improved, insight, Visual, Funding, Long-Evans Rats, Sensory, Source, Pattern, restoration, experience, visual deprivation, neuroregulation, neural control, neural regulation, neuromodulation, neuromodulatory, cholinergic, response, theories, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Resolution, resolutions, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, Process, Behavioral, Image, imaging, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, Pyramidal neuron, design, designing, non rapid eye movement, NREM, non-REM, non-rapid eye movement, nonREM, nonrapid eye movement, basal forebrain, scale up, Population, Synaptic plasticity, neocortical, V1 neuron, monocular, effective therapy, effective treatment, optogenetics, learned behavior, learning behavior, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Behavioral states such as sleep and wake profoundly affect the patterns of activity and neuromodulatory tone
within neocortical circuits, but the function of these state changes on learning and experience-dependent
plasticity remain controversial. It has been postulated that wake is when Hebbian mechanisms are engaged,
while sleep serves to homeostatically “renormalize” synaptic strengths/firing rates that were perturbed by
experience-dependent changes in the waking state. We study the homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that
stabilize firing rates and circuit function within primary visual cortex (V1), and can track this process in freely
behaving rodents. Perturbing firing through monocular visual deprivation (MD) initially suppresses firing (1-
2d MD), but firing rates then rebound to control levels over a 2 d period despite continued MD. Further, we can
perturb firing in the other direction using an MD followed by eye re-opening (ER) paradigm, and observed that
firing rates are potentiated by ER and again slowly return to baseline values. This ‘firing rate homeostasis’ is
accomplished in part through synaptic scaling up or down of excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons
within V1. We can follow this process in freely behaving animals cycling between natural bouts of sleep and
wake, to directly determine when the homeostatic restoration of firing occurs. In the last funding period we
made the surprising discovery that upward and downward firing rate homeostasis are oppositely regulated by
sleep and wake states: upward occurs gradually during each bout of active wake and is suppressed by sleep,
while downward is enabled by sleep and suppressed by wake. Our work reveals that sleep and wake states are
critically important for gating homeostatic plasticity, and act to segregate upward and downward homeostatic
processes into distinct behavioral states. How this is accomplished mechanistically is entirely unknown, as is
the function this segregation might serve. Here we propose to determine the features of waking/sleeping states
that enable/suppress firing rate homeostasis, and to test whether the underlying synaptic plasticity
mechanisms are themselves directly gated by sleep and wake. Finally, to gain insight into the
behavioral/functional consequences of this gating, we propose to test how sleep and wake orchestrate Hebbian
and homeostatic plasticity within V1 during a vision-dependent learning task. These experiments promise to
illuminate fundamental features of visual cortical physiology, and to shed light on the function of sleep and
wake states in coordinating synaptic plasticity during learning.</description><investigator><investigatorId>TURRIGIANO, GINA G</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01EY022360</grantId><grantName>A genetic and genomic resource for vision research</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1984091.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-01</startDate><endDate>2018-08-31</endDate><keyword>Age, Behavior, Breeding, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Exhibits, Feedback, Gene Expression, Genes, Modern Man, Human, Posterior Quadrigeminal Body, Inferior Colliculus, Libraries, Mammalia, Mammals, Maps, Methods, Transgenic Mice, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Mus, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Phenotype, Physiology, Proteins, Researchers, Investigators, Research Personnel, Research Resources, Resources, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Rodent, social role, Role, somesthetic sensory cortex, Somatosensory Cortex, Striate area, Striate Cortex, Primary visual cortex, area striata, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, recombinase, Measures, Enhancers, promoter, promotor, Green Fluorescent Proteins, genetic manipulation, Label, Specified, Specific qualifier value, Physiologic, Physiological, Link, visual tectum, Superior Colliculus, Optic Tectum, Anterior Quadrigeminal Body, superior colliculus Corpora quadrigemina, Visual, data repository, clinical data repository, Databanks, Data Bases, Data Banks, Databases, Gene Targeting, root, Plant Roots, Genetic, Morphology, Reporter, tool, cell type, Pattern, System, interest, Visual System, Visual system structure, experience, knockout gene, transgenic, Transgenic Organisms, Structure, novel, Property, response, deprivation, Genomics, Data, molecular signature, molecular profile, Molecular Fingerprinting, Expression Profiling, Molecular Profiling, Mouse Strains, Tet, Tetanus Helper Peptide, Molecular, Knockout, Knock-out, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, transcriptional signature, gene expression signature, gene expression pattern, Expression Signature, Gene Expression Profile, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, scale up, Population, Synaptic plasticity, Vision research, innovation, innovative, innovate, transgene expression, monocular deprivation, overexpression, overexpress, over-expression, critical period, genome-wide, genomewide, genome scale, Genomic approach, genomic strategy, genomic effort, genomic tools, transcriptome,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic manipulation of the mammalian visual system is currently limited by available tools for targeting gene knockout or overexpression to specific neuronal cell types, and is further hampered by an incomplete understanding of the normal gene expression in those cell types.

single defect that is present in all sufferers, but rather from the systems-level impact of the interaction of any
number of malfunctioning circuit elements. In order to understand how the elements of brain circuits interact
during development and to shed light on how these processes go awry in diseases or injuries, it is important to
investigate whole systems in the intact, living brain. To this end, we have developed a system via which we can
study how individual mammalian cortical neurons change their properties when the circuit is modified by
behaviorally relevant stimuli.
 This application proposes studies of the circuit mechanisms underlying the experience-dependent
development of motion selectivity in the ferret visual cortex. At the time of eye opening, ferret visual cortex
exhibits orientation selectivity and orientation columns, but neurons are not yet selective for direction-of-
motion, a property of most mature neurons in this species. Motion selectivity (that is, direction selectivity)
arises in the days and weeks following eye opening, and requires visual experience. However, recent
experiments show that this experience has a primarily permissive influence on development, in that many
parameters such as direction preference angle and speed tuning are primarily determined before the onset of
visual experience.
 The first aim addresses the degree to which the activity in the cortex before eye opening determines the
tuning parameters that can be uncovered through visual experience. We will provide animals with artificial
experience with carefully designed “arbitrary” patterns to examine how tuning parameters can be modified.
Alternatively, the activity in cortex before eye opening may itself be permissive and activity-independent factors
may determine tuning parameters.
 The second aim tests a novel hypothesis about the development of functional connections in early
development. The classic idea is that connections are substantially overproduced and that experience and
plasticity serve to prune inappropriate connections. Instead, we will test the idea that receptive fields start out
small and grow in a manner that is largely determined at the onset of visual experience.
 The third aim directly examines the functional connections between LGN and cortex that might underlie
direction selectivity and its development.
 Concurrently with the aims, a computational model of the ferret visual cortex will be constructed to
illuminate the possible combinations of synaptic plasticity rules and initial circuit structure that could underlie
the development of direction selectivity and speed tuning.</description><investigator><investigatorId>VAN HOOSER, STEPHEN D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01EY014439</grantId><grantName>Inhibitory and homeostatic plasticity in developing visual cortex</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3076386.99</amount><startDate>2003-07-01</startDate><endDate>2018-06-30</endDate><keyword>Abbreviations, Affect, Amblyopia, Axon, Cells, Conflict, Conflict (Psychology), depression, Mental Depression, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Eyeball, Eye, Goals, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, In Vitro, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Interneurons, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Methods, Play, Probability, Research, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Rodent, social role, Role, Sensory Deprivation, Sutures, Surgical sutures, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, visual function, Sight, Vision, visually impaired, Subnormal Vision, Reduced Vision, Partial Sight, Low Vision, Diminished Vision, Visual impairment, visual cortical, Visual Cortex, Work, Relative, Relative (related person), Mediating, Variation, Variant, Long-Term Potentiation, Basket Cell, Myoepithelial cell, Visual, Funding, Potentiation, Chemosensitization/Potentiation, Chemosensitization, Genetic, Eye Dominance, Ocular Dominance, postnatal, cell type, visual loss, vision loss, Blindness, Viral, Visual System, Visual system structure, experience, Receptor Protein, receptor, visual deprivation, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Regulation, response, long term depression, Long-Term Synaptic Depression, Long-Term Depression (Neurophysiology), Long-Term Depression (Physiology), preventing, prevent, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, transfer of a gene, Gene Transfer, Slice, Transmission, transmission process, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, designing, design, Population, Synaptic plasticity, presynaptic, neocortical, monocular deprivation, monocular, critical period, effective treatment, effective therapy, optogenetics,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proper functioning of the mature visual system depends upon experience-dependent refinement of cortical circuitry during early postnatal development. Visual deprivation during this early "critical period" (CP) can lead to loss of visual
responsiveness to the deprived eye (amblyopia). Despite decades of research it is still unclear which cellular plasticity mechanism(s) contribute to this loss of visual responsiveness, and by extension are required for the normal development of visual function. For example, long-term depression (LTD) of cortical excitatory synapses has been suggested to be necessary and sufficient for loss of visual responsiveness following MD, while other studies have raised the possibility that potentiation of inhibition plays a critical role in this process. Recently the maturation of inhibition from fast-spiking GABAergic basket cells (FS cells) has been implicated in the regulation of CP onset, but why mature inhibition is necessary for CP plasticity is still unknown. During the past 2 funding periods we found that monocular deprivation (MD) during the rodent CP dramatically potentiates inhibitory transmission at FS synapses onto star pyramidal neurons (SP, the major excitatory cell type within L4 of rodent V1), by inducing a novel form of long-term potentiation of inhibition (LTPi) at this synapse. Further, LTPi is developmentally regulated, turns on coincidently with the opening of the CP, and manipulations that delay or advance the CP also delay or advance the ability of FS synapses to express LTPi. In this proposal we wish to test the central hypothesis that LTPi plays a critical role in the lossof visual responsiveness induced by visual deprivation, so that FS cells initiate the CP by gaining the ability to express LTPi. To this end we will exploit our mechanistic understanding of LTPi to block its induction in vivo, and determine the role LTPi plays in the cortical response to monocular deprivation (MD). Further, we will evaluate the relative importance of LTD and LTPi in MD-induced loss of visual responsiveness within L4, and ask whether these two forms of plasticity are induced in a synergistic manner during MD. We will combine in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, viral-mediated gene transfer, and optogenetics to achieve these goals. These experiments will settle a long-standing debate about the mechanisms underlying amblyopia, and have the potential to radically alter our view of the cellular underpinnings of CP plasticity. )</description><investigator><investigatorId>TURRIGIANO, GINA G</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01EY007965</grantId><grantName>Structure-Function Studies of Rhodopsin</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3487737.0</amount><startDate>1988-12-01</startDate><endDate>2019-03-31</endDate><keyword>Crystallization, Detergents, Disorder, Disease, Evolution, Goals, Grant, Health, Light, Photoradiation, Lipid Bilayers, lipid bilayer membrane, Fluorescence Microscopy, Fluorescence Light Microscopy, Molecular Conformation, conformational state, conformation, Molecular Stereochemistry, Molecular Configuration, Night Blindness, Nyctalopia, Photoreceptors, Visual Receptor, Photosensitive Cell, Photoreceptor Cell, Pigments, Proteins, Retina, Retinal Pigments, retina photosensitive pigment, Visual Pigments, Retinitis Pigmentosa, Tapetoretinal Degeneration, Rod-Cone Dystrophy, Pigmentary Retinopathy, Rhodopsin, Visual Purple, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Inhibitory Gt G-Protein, Transducin, visual function, Sight, Vision, Work, Xrays, X-Rays Radiation, X-Rays, X-Radiation, Roentgen Rays, Zebra Fish, Zebra Danio, Danio rerio, Brachydanio rerio, Zebrafish, Salamander, Area, Active Sites, rod cell, Rod Photoreceptors, Rod, retinal rods, Visual, Funding, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Functional disorder, Tigers, Panthera tigris, tool, Phototransduction, Visual Transduction, Light Signal Transduction, Arrestins, Retinal S-Antigen, Complex, System, Location, mutant, photoactivation, visual phototransduction, Structure, novel, member, Positioning Attribute, Position, Property, single molecule, GRK1 gene, rhodopsin kinase, RHOK, GRK1, Address, Molecular, developmental, Development, nanometer sized, nanometer scale, nano scale, nano meter sized, nano meter scale, nanoscale, nano disk, nanodisk, public health relevance, GNB5 gene, GNB5, GB5,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term focus of this grant continues to be the structure and function of the visual pigment rhodopsin and its interactions with other members of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade. The studies are geared toward an understanding of the protein in terms of its mechanism of activation, its interaction with downstream proteins of the phototransduction cascade, and its function and dysfunction in health and disease. The new studies focus on two areas: the development and exploitation of a single-molecule approach to the study of interactions among signaling partners in the visual phototransduction cascade, and the characterization of novel mutants of rhodopsin in which the active site of the protein has been significantly altered from the wild-type. There are two Specific Aims: 1. to establish, characterize, and expand Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) as a tool in the single-molecule regime to study the dynamics of assembly and disassembly of key signaling complexes in the rod cell phototransduction cascade. One of the major goals of this aim is to better understand the role of constitutively active mutants in the diseases retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness. 2. To characterize novel rhodopsin mutants in which the highly conserved active-site Lys296 has been moved to different locations in the protein. This Aim expands upon surprising preliminary results showing that the Lys can be moved while maintaining near wild-type spectral properties and ability to activate transducin in a light-dependent manner. The focus is to better understand the evolutionary relatedness of retinylidene proteins and to probe our understanding of the molecular mechanism of photoactivation of rhodopsin.</description><investigator><investigatorId>OPRIAN, DANIEL D</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DC007703</grantId><grantName>Temporal Coding and Palatability in Gustatory Cortex</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5141531.58</amount><startDate>2006-04-01</startDate><endDate>2026-05-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Amygdala, Amygdaloid Body, Amygdaloid Nucleus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, Amygdaloid structure, driving, Automobile Driving, Axon, Dorsum, Back, Behavior, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Brain, Brainstem, Brain Stem, Cell Body, Cells, Decision Making, Deglutition, Swallowing, Disease, Disorder, Eating, Food Intake, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Emotions, Food, Hunger, Hypothalamic structure, Hypothalamus, hypothalamic, Lighting, Illumination, Movement, body movement, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Optics, optical, Perception, Periodicity, Cyclicity, Rhythmicity, Play, Population Dynamics, Production, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Rodent, Rodentia, Rodents Mammals, Role, social role, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Signal Transduction, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Taste Perception, Testing, thoughts, Thinking, Thirst, Time, Tongue, Work, Generations, Prosencephalon, Fore-Brain, Forebrain, Dissociation, Mediating, Green Fluorescent Proteins, Lateral, Site, biologic, Biological, Non-linear Dynamic, Non-linear Dynamics, Nonlinear Dynamic, Nonlinear Dynamics, Buccal Cavity, Buccal Cavity Head and Neck, Cavitas Oris, Mouth, Oral cavity, insight, Stimulus, awake, sugar, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, tool, Nature, fighting, Complex, Oral, cell type, System, central pattern generator, sensorimotor system, sensory motor system, neural, Structure, novel, Reporting, Code, Coding System, Sampling, Property, response, sweet taste perception, sweet taste, Brain region, Motor, Monitor, Molecular, Process, Pathway interactions, pathway, Output, orofacial, feeding, Consumption, Coupled, Coupling, optogenetics, taste system, gustatory system, brain circuitry, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by virtue of
activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that cause us to eat
more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more interesting: a taste hits the
tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing food-related information back and forth as
the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this
process by recording from multiple parts of the taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes.
We have observed this decision-making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report,
in turn, that a taste is on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the
taste; this last step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in
the rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves and
requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do rigorous tests of
where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles played by amygdala and
hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole,
this research project has the potential to completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in
new thinking about perception in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given
the complexity of brain circuitry.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KATZ, DONALD B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DC006666</grantId><grantName>Amygdala-cortical interactions in taste perception and learning</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4632183.42</amount><startDate>2005-07-01</startDate><endDate>2026-03-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Amygdala, Amygdaloid Body, Amygdaloid Nucleus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, Amygdaloid structure, driving, Automobile Driving, Axon, Dorsum, Back, Behavior, Cell Body, Cells, 0-11 years old, Child Youth, Children (0-21), kids, youngster, Child, Deglutition, Swallowing, Electrophysiology (science), Electrophysiology, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, electrophysiological, Foundations, Genes, Grant, Human, Modern Man, Interneurons, Connector Neuron, Intercalary Neuron, Intercalated Neurons, Internuncial Cell, Internuncial Neuron, Learning, Maintenance, Mammals, Mammalia, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Optics, optical, Parents, parent, Perception, Play, Pregnancy, Gestation, Rattus, Common Rat Strains, Rat, Rats Mammals, Research, Role, social role, Saccharin, 1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one, 1,1-dioxide, Synaptic, synapse, Synapses, Gustation, Taste, gustatory perception, gustatory processing, gustatory response, taste processing, taste response, Taste Perception, Testing, Time, Tongue, Gene Transcription, RNA Expression, Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Vertebrate Animals, vertebrata, Vertebrates, Work, Prosencephalon, Fore-Brain, Forebrain, Acute, KO mice, Knock-out Mice, Null Mouse, Knockout Mice, Link, Training, Individual, Progress Reports, Collaborations, Transgenes, Genetic, tool, Investigation, Complex, System, Viral, experience, neural, Transgenic Organisms, transgenic, Structure, memory retrieval, Neurophysiology - biologic function, neural function, Code, Coding System, response, Brain region, Data, transmission process, Transmission, Molecular, Process, follow-up, Active Follow-up, active followup, follow up, followed up, followup, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, feeding, neuronal excitability, Perceptual learning, Population, Mind, neuromechanism, neural mechanism, Coupling, Impairment, Taste aversion, Conditioned Taste Aversion, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, DREADDs, experimental study, experiment, experimental research, experiments, conditional knockout, conditional knock-out,</keyword><description>The neural system underlying conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is, like all systems underlying perceptual
learning, highly complex—learning-relevant regions, most notably including basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and gustatory cortex (GC), work together to make learning happen. While most research to date has
focused on the role of each individual region in learning, rather than their influence on each other, my lab’s
work is a direct investigation of inter-neuronal and inter-regional interactions during taste learning. This
work has demonstrated that the coupling between BLA and GC taste responses is important for both basic
taste processing and for CTA learning: blocking transmission in the BLAàGC pathway interferes with the
coherent emergence of palatability-related information in GC ensemble taste codes (information that
appears relatively late in GC responses), and keeps learning from happening; it is therefore reasonable to
propose that activity in BLAàGC axons is vital for learning-related plasticity in those GC ensemble
responses—that is, in the changes to late-appearing palatability-related coding. The experiments proposed
here will build upon this foundation, and on recent work by collaborators, to test this overarching
hypothesis. First we will acutely and selectively silence BLAàGC axons, and test whether this perturbation
blocks learning- and behavior-linked changes in GC population responses. We will then test whether
recently-identified learning-related transcription changes occurring in BLAàGC projection neurons are
necessary for the induction and maintenance of GC taste response plasticity caused by CTA. Finally, we
will test whether intrinsic excitability in the connection between BLA and GC—which appears to be
increased in mice that fail to learn, and decreased in projection neurons that are involved in learning—is
the parameter controlling learning-related changes in GC network activity. Together, these experiments
will be the first to directly and specifically relate cellular/molecular plasticity processes to the emergent
dynamics of network function in vertebrates. In the process, they will reveal new facets of the neural
mechanisms of a more general experiential phenomenon that affects (sometimes adversely) all mammals
including humans.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KATZ, DONALD B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA043195</grantId><grantName>CRCNS: Neural signals that maintain/refresh LTP and memory</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>1090708.59</amount><startDate>2017-05-01</startDate><endDate>2021-10-31</endDate><keyword>Achievement, Achievement Attainment, Action Potentials, Affect, Basal Ganglia, Basal Nuclei, Ursidae Family, bear, Ursidae, Bears, Cell Body, Cells, virtual simulation, in silico, computerized simulation, computerized modeling, computer based models, computational simulation, computational models, computational modeling, Mathematical Models and Simulations, Mathematical Model Simulation, Computerized Models, Computer based Simulation, Computer Models, Computer Simulation, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, DNA, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, Fluorescence, Fractionation Radiotherapy, FRACN, Chemical Fractionation, Fractionation, Health, hippocampal, Hippocampus, Cornu Ammonis, Ammon Horn, Hippocampus (Brain), In Vitro, Maintenance, Memory, Cognitive Retention Disorders, Memory Disorders, Methods, Theoretic Models, Theoretical model, Molecular Weight, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Nobel Prize, Protein Phosphorylation, Phosphorylation, Potassium Ion Channels, K channel, Potassium Channel, Proteins, Rats Mammals, Rat, Common Rat Strains, Rattus, Rest, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral vascular accident, brain attack, Cerebrovascular Stroke, Cerebrovascular Apoplexy, Cerebral Stroke, Brain Vascular Accident, Apoplexy, Stroke, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, Time, Work, Measures, Addictive Behavior, Mediating, dentate gyrus, Gyrus Dentatus, Fascia Dentata, Dentate Fascia, Label, Site, Acute, Biochemical, Ensure, Stimulus, Information Storage, Holoenzymes, Transgenes, SNAP receptor, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor, SNARE, NSF attachment protein receptor, Physiologic pulse, Pulse, Dependence, Event, Reaction, Closure by clamp, Clampings, interest, protein degradation, Regulatory Protein Degradation, Protein Turnover, Metabolic Protein Degradation, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, FRET, Protein Subunits, relating to nervous system, neural, Catalytic Domain, Catalytic Subunit, Catalytic Site, Catalytic Region, Catalytic Core, reaction rate, chemical reaction rate, neurotransmission, neuronal signaling, neural signaling, nerve signaling, glial signaling, glia signaling, axonal signaling, axon-glial signaling, axon signaling, Neuronal Transmission, Nerve Transmission, Nerve Impulse Transmission, Modeling, Property, Dendritic Spines, dendrite spine, Mushroom Bodies, Dominant-Negative Mutation, Dominant-Negative Mutant, Dominant Negative, Antimorphic mutation, in vivo, Slice, Preparation, Molecular, Process, Modification, Behavioral, Instruction, reconstitution, reconstitute, addiction, addictive disorder, overexpression, overexpress, experimental study, experimental research, experiment,</keyword><description>Experiments show that interference with CaMKI I after LTP can erase LTP, a strong indication of the
importance of CaMKll in the LTP maintenance process. CaMKll holoenzymes contain 12 catalytic subunits.
In the ON state, each subunit is phosphorylated and therefore active. When a site becomes
dephosphorylated, it can be refreshed (rephosphorylated) by a neighboring active subunit.
Aim 1. Is refresh dependent on activity? The CaMKll refresh process requires low levels of Ca, but
whether achievement of this level is dependent on spontaneous neural activity is not known. Therefore, a
fundamental question of interest is whether the maintenance of LTP or memory requires neural activity. In
Aim 1A, we will test this in acute hippocampal slices. In Aim 1B, we will explore whether activity is necessary
for maintaining memory at the behavioral level using Drosophila. Although it is known that CaMKll is
important for Drosophila memory, experiments have not yet tested whether CaMKll is important in memory
maintenance. Given the importance of this issue for interpreting the effects of activity on memory, we will
conduct the critical erasure test for determining whether CaMKll mediates memory storage in Drosophila.
Aim 2. Does CaMKll subunit exchange occur in vivo: a potential mechanism for molecular refresh?
According to theoretical models, switch stability could long outlive the lifetime of any subunit if CaMKll
underwent protein turnover by subunit exchange: a newly inserted unphosphorylated subunit could be
phosphorylated by a neighboring phosphorylated subunit, thereby providing a molecular refresh. We will
make the first attempts to test whether subunit exchange occurs in living cells (Drosophila and hippocampus)
and characterize its activity-dependence.
Aim 3. Computational modelling: what kinds of neural activity are required to refresh CaMKll
phosphorylation? The level of resting Ca2+, and that during spontaneous action potentials or mEPSPs can
be estimate, as well as the rate of these reactions. We will use a verified computational model of CaMKll to
determine whether these brief Ca2+ events are sufficient to refresh the phosphorylated state of CaMKll and
thus ensure the stability of stored information. The results will bear importantly on the fundamental question
of whether refresh reactions are mediated by spontaneous activity, or alternatively, are dependent on a
network process that replays memories.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Understanding the processes that store memory at synapses will have major implications for several health
problems. In particular, addiction has been demonstrated to involve persistent changes in CaMKll at
synapses in the basal ganglia networks that are critical for addictive behaviors. The proposed work may
provide ways to turn off CaMKll and thus reduce addictive behaviors. CaMKll has also been strongly
implicated in memory disorders and stroke.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GRIFFITH, LESLIE C</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA037721</grantId><grantName>Addressing protein synthesis regulation within small numbers of discrete neurons</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2431072.0</amount><startDate>2013-09-30</startDate><endDate>2023-01-31</endDate><keyword>Behavior, Mental disorders, Mental health disorders, Psychiatric Disease, Psychiatric Disorder, mental illness, psychiatric illness, psychological disorder, Biological Assay, Assay, Bioassay, Biologic Assays, Biology, Brain, Brain Nervous System, Encephalon, Cell physiology, Cell Function, Cell Process, Cellular Function, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Process, Subcellular Process, Cells, Cell Body, Circadian Rhythms, Nyctohemeral Rhythm, Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm, circadian process, daily biorhythm, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Goals, Grant, Health, Human, Modern Man, In Vitro, Light, Photoradiation, Mammals, Mammalia, Methods, Molecular Biology, DNA Molecular Biology, Motor Activity, Locomotor Activity, Nerve Degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, neural degeneration, neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative, neurological degeneration, neuronal degeneration, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Neurosciences, Noise, Paper, Proteins, Publications, Scientific Publication, Ribosomal Proteins, Ribosomes, RNA, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, RNA Gene Products, Ribonucleic Acid, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Signal Transduction, Cell Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Signaling, biological signal transduction, Stroke, Apoplexy, Brain Vascular Accident, Cerebral Stroke, Cerebrovascular Apoplexy, Cerebrovascular Stroke, brain attack, cerebral vascular accident, cerebrovascular accident, Substance Addiction, Substance Dependence, Time, Translating, Translations, Tribes, Work, Yeasts, Poly(A)-Binding Proteins, Poly(A)+ mRNA Binding Protein, RNA-Binding Proteins, Mediating, RNA Sequences, Intention, RNA Editing, RNA, Messenger, Editing, improved, Variant, Variation, Biological, Biochemical, Measurement, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, TDP-43, TDP43, protein TDP43, protein TDP-43, Protein Dimerization, Dimerization, programs, Event, Source, Techniques, System, Clock protein, interest, brain cell, Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis, Ribosomal Protein Synthesis, protein synthesis, Protein Biosynthesis, translation factor, Catalytic Core, Catalytic Region, Catalytic Site, Catalytic Subunit, Catalytic Domain, novel, abuse of substances, substance abuse, Substance abuse problem, Regulation, response, Molecular Interaction, Binding, tissue/cell culture, Ortholog, Orthologous Gene, Address, Post-Transcriptional Control, post-transcriptional gene regulation, posttranscriptional control, posttranscriptional regulation, Post-Transcriptional Regulation, in vivo, Fusion Protein Expression, Transcript, Translational Regulation, RNA Recognition Motif, Putative RNA-Binding Region, RNA Binding Domain, RNP Domain, RNP Motif, RNP-1 Signature, fly, Flies, novel strategies, new approaches, novel approaches, novel strategy, overexpression, overexpress, transcriptome sequencing, RNA Seq, RNA sequencing, RNAseq, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR, CRISPR/Cas system, Knock-in, knockin, circadian,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Recent publications indicate that post-transcriptional regulation makes an important contribution to
circadian rhythms, in flies and in mammals. This evidence is now quite extensive and includes
translational regulation, which impacts the synthesis of key clock proteins within the mammalian SCN as
well as within the small number of central brain neurons that govern Drosophila circadian locomotor
activity rhythms. These neurons pose a significant challenge – and opportunity – for circadian biology and
for molecular biology more generally: how can one assess biochemical events within a few neurons? For
almost all measurements, there is not enough signal and/or a problematic signal:noise ratio when an
extract is made and assayed starting with only a few cells/brain. Even methods that tag brain neurons are
plagued with this problem if the fraction of tagged neurons/brain is very low. To address this issue in the
context of RNA binding proteins and their targets, my lab developed a new technique, which we call
TRIBE (Targets of RNA Binding proteins Identified by Editing). It fuses the catalytic domain of the RNA
editing enzyme ADAR to RNA binding proteins. TRIBE takes advantage of the fact that one can make
clean RNA and sequence it even from a single cell despite the inability to work with an extract from the
same source material. We have used TRIBE with three different RBPs and also showed that it can work
within the “small number of specific neurons” context. We have recently validated TRIBE and improved its
efficacy, so that it has many fewer false negatives, i.e., it recognizes a much greater fraction of RBP-
associated mRNAs. We will extend the method in two new translation-centric directions: to identify
specific targets of the important translation factor eIF4E-BP and to identify ribosome-associated
transcripts. We also propose to address some remaining issues, and extend TRIBE in new directions,
with CRISPR-mediated knock-ins as well as with dimerization approaches. The latter will bring the editing
moiety to the RNA on command, i.e., in response to a drug- or light-mediated dimerization signal. In all
cases, assaying successfully small numbers of discrete neurons is the key biological focus. It is an
important goal relevant to many human health problems like mental illness, neurodegeneration, stroke,
substance abuse and addiction.</description><investigator><investigatorId>ROSBASH, MICHAEL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA033468</grantId><grantName>Incentives and Alerts for Improving Performance in Washington State</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2038440.79</amount><startDate>2012-04-15</startDate><endDate>2018-03-31</endDate><keyword>Client, Community Mental Health Services, Continuum of Care, Continuity of Care, Continuity of Patient Care, Control Groups, Goals, History, Recording of previous events, Incentives, Information Technology Systems, IT Systems, Data Systems, Information Systems, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Photoradiation, Light, detoxification, Metabolism of Toxic Agents, Metabolic Drug Detoxications, Drug Metabolic Detoxification, Drug Metabolic Detoxication, web based, online computer, On-Line Systems, Online Systems, Out-patients, Outpatients, Research, Rewards, Risk, Rural Population, Specialty, medical specialties, Substance Use Disorder, Testing, Time, United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, Washington, Generations, Measures, Outcome Measure, Process Measure, base, improved, Area, Individual, Recovery, Rural, Measurement, Collaborations, tool, programs, Adopted, System, meetings, Services, experience, Performance, success, novel, treatment program, Prevention, Reporting, substance abuse, abuse of substances, Substance abuse problem, behavioral health, QOC, Quality of Care, response, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Provider, disparity in health, health disparity, Data, randomly assigned, randomization, randomisation, Randomized, Characteristics, Process, followed up, follow up, Active Follow-up, follow-up, substance abuse therapy, substance abuse treatment, designing, design, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies, Outcome, innovation, innovative, innovate, ethnic minority population, ethnic minority, racial and ethnic, financial incentive, dashboard,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incentives and Alerts for Improving Performance in Washington State Information on treatment process measures (e.g. initiation, engagement, and continuity of care measures) can be useful to specialty substance abuse treatment programs for tracking their performance and targeting areas for quality improvement efforts. The Washington State Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR) will collaborate to study the impacts of two interventions, financial incentives and a client-specific alert system, on program performance and client outcomes. Client-specific alerts will be an enhancement to the data systems that are already in place in the state. Focusing on outpatient, intensive outpatient, detoxification, and residential programs, the alerts will provide programs with information, on a weekly basis, regarding specific clients who may not be meeting recommended levels of services so programs will be able to follow up with these clients with the goal of improving their performance measures. The proposed design will randomize programs in Washington State into the following study groups: Group A (Control Group), Group B (Incentives Only Group), Group C (Alerts Only Group) Group D (Incentives and Alerts Group). The differential impacts of these two interventions on the quality of care for subpopulations that may experience health disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations) will also be examined. Finally, the influenceof client and treatment program characteristics on the impacts of incentives and alert systems will be explored. The specific aims are as follows:  1. Examine if offering incentives only or providing
client-specific alerts only leads to improved program performance and client outcomes.  2.

Performance-based contracting (PBC) aims to align treatment program incentives and purchaser goals to drive high-quality care, yet is uncommon in drug abuse treatment systems. Because improvements will require changes by programs, clinicians and staff, it may be beneficial to incentivize these groups to work together. Design features are paramount in the effectiveness of P4P, yet few controlled trials of different incentive designs have been conducted and open questions remain on particular design features that contribute to effective systems. In 2007, Maine implemented a 2nd-generation PBC system with financial incentives for outpatient programs that receive federal block grant funding. Using Maine as a laboratory, we go beyond evaluation of an SUD treatment PBC to focus on unintended effects and outcomes; test a payment design that rewards clinicians/front-line staff for program performance by sending quarterly checks directly to clinicians/staff whose program meets their targets; and delve into response to incentives by both programs and clinicians, to understand how treatment programs and clinicians adapt organizational, management and clinical practices due to such incentives. The proposed study, conducted in collaboration with Maine's Office of Substance Abuse, will use administrative data and data collected from program interviews and clinician/staff surveys, incorporating multilevel modeling and a difference-in-difference approach. PBC is a significant change in payment design and may affect how SUD treatment services are delivered. As prevalence of PBC and other forms of P4P continue to increase, it is critical to understand how programs respond to PBC initiatives. This ability to focus on the "black box" of response to incentives is a unique and innovative aspect of the proposed study. Aims 1 and 2 use retrospective data from the ongoing Maine PBC that began in 2007. For Aims 3 and 4, we overlay a new approach to how incentives are distributed at a program level and examine this with a randomized design. Specifically, we aim to:  1. Determine if the PBC improved the rewarded measures of access and retention and determine what, if  any, positive or negative unintended effects stemmed from the PBC.  2. Examine how client outcomes were affected by the PBC, controlling for adverse selection if identified,  and determine associated organizational factors.  3. Test in a randomized trial at the program level whether the addition of
clinician group incentives, paid  directly to clinicians and front-line staff to reward overall program performance as defined by the PBC,  improves program performance.  4. Determine what changes, if any, are implemented by programs (e.g., quality improvement initiatives) or  by clinicians (e.g., outreach to clients) after introduction of incentives.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01DA029316</grantId><grantName>Provision of Drug Abuse Treatment Services Under Parity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2739913.0</amount><startDate>2010-04-01</startDate><endDate>2015-01-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Alcohol Chemical Class, Alcohols, 6,14-Ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-alpha-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-alpha-methyl-, (5alpha,7alpha(S))-, Buprenorphine, Diffusion, abuses drugs, abuse of drugs, Drug abuse, Drug Use Disorder, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Economics, Environment, ontogeny, Tissue Growth, Generalized Growth, Growth, Health, Health Care Systems, Healthcare Systems, Health Plan Implementation, Health Planning, health care service, Health Services, healthcare service availability, healthcare service access, healthcare access availability, health services availability, health care service availability, health care service access, health care availability, care access, availability of services, access to treatment, access to services, access to health services, Availability of Health Services, Accessibility of health care, Access to Healthcare, Access to Health Care, Access to Care, Health Services Accessibility, Virus-HIV, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus, LAV-HTLV-III, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III, Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III, Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, HTLV-III, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus, AIDS Virus, HIV, inducement, Incentives, Health Insurance, Legislation, Statutes and Laws, Photoradiation, Light, Psychological Health, Mental Hygiene, Mental Health, Mental Hygiene Services, Mental Health Services, Methods, parity, parity, Patients, Preferred Provider Organizations, Primary Healthcare, Primary Care, Primary Health Care, Scientific Publication, Publications, social role, Role, Specialty, medical specialties, Survey Instrument, Surveys, Time, Vendor, Drug Delivery, Drug Delivery Systems, Cost Sharing, Managed Care, DA-10, DA10, Caring, enhancing factor, quality assurance, Procedures, Area, Clinical, Medical, Funding, world wide web, web, WWW, Internet, Contracting Opportunities, Contracts, Diagnostic, Nature, Knowledge, Insurance Status, Insurance Coverage, Disorder Management, Disease Management, programs, Adopted, Complex, Health Care Markets, Healthcare Market, Services, surgical service, Performance, Exclusion, payment, Coding System, Code, Regulation, Modeling, behavioral health, response, Drops, Provider, Data, National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, National Institute of Drug Abuse, enroll, Enrollment, Update, Characteristics, followed up, follow up, Active Follow-up, follow-up, Electronic Health Record, cost, designing, design, Drug Abuse Treatment Services, Drug Abuse Treatment Services, prospective, NIAAA, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, innovative, innovate, innovation, risk sharing, addictive disorder, addiction, screening,</keyword><description>  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the health care system make it necessary to regularly update our knowledge of how services for drug use disorders are provided. It is particularly important in the current environment because of the recent passage of federal parity legislation which requires group health plans offering mental health/addiction services to cover these services in a comparable manner to medical/ surgical services, effective January 1, 2010 for most health plans. Building on two previous rounds of our health plan survey, we propose to (1) enhance the "core" third round planned for 2010 by adding specific questions on drug abuse treatment and an in-depth module on parity, and (2) conduct a follow-up survey in 2012 focused on health plan response after final parity regulations have been issued and the 2011 cost opt-out provision is finished. The specific aims are:   
* Describe the provision of services for drug use disorders in private health plans in terms of administrative and clinical factors by enhancing a survey for benefit year 2010 to specifically focus on drug abuse services and analyze changes in health plans' provision of these services in the last decade by comparing to previous rounds of the survey in 1999 and 2003.   
* Study health plans' specific responses to the implementation of federal parity legislation on January 1, 2010 with an in-depth analysis of changes that were specifically adopted because of parity, by enhancing the 2010 survey through a special module on parity.   
*  Study health plans' further responses to federal parity legislation in benefit year 2012, following both the requirement that all plans opting out in 2011 participate in 2012 and the issuance of clarifying final regulations expected to go into effect in 2011.   
* Model changes from benefit year 2010 to 2012 in health plans' implementation of parity, reflecting changes in response to parity regulations and the cost opt-out provision.   
The proposed study of drug treatment services will combine the 1999, 2003, and the 2010 rounds and the 2012 parity follow-up of our nationally representative health plan survey in a prospective design that will allow us to track how the delivery of drug services evolves within the changing health care market. It will specifically focus on issues related to federal parity, particularly health plan response in light of regulations and cost opt- out provisions.

cause resistance to cancer therapy. There are urgent needs to develop innovative approaches to meet these
challenges. The proposed study is to develop subcellular enzyme-instructed self-assembly (sEISA), which
includes mitochondrial EISA (mitoEISA) and cytoplasmic EISA (cytoEISA), for generating molecular nanofibers
to overcome drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy. Our preliminary studies have shown
that sEISA selectively targets the mitochondria of cancer cells and minimizes drug resistance. Most importantly,
our preliminary study shows that sEISA inhibits the growth of immunosuppressive tumors in vivo. Thus, we
propose to further develop sEISA against drug resistant cancer cells and tumors. The proposed research has
three specific aims: Aim 1, developing mitoEISA for selectively targeting cancer cells; Aim 2, developing
cytoEISA for minimizing drug resistance and immunosuppression; and Aim 3, evaluating sEISA in ovarian
cancer xenograft murine models. The central hypothesis is that sEISA spatiotemporally generates molecular
nanofibers, which interact with multiple cellular proteins and interrupt multiple cellular processes inside cancer
cells to minimize drug resistance. Our preliminary results support the central hypothesis. The innovation is that
the mechanisms of the action of the molecular nanofibers significantly depart from the ligand-receptor dogma of
the current anticancer drugs. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop sEISA to generate molecular
nanofibers for overcoming resistance in cancer therapy. We anticipate that this research will provide innovative
anticancer approaches to address the problems of drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy,
thus ultimately will improve the survivorship of cancer patients.</description><investigator><investigatorId>XU, BING

 In 2016, the US Department of Health and Human Services released the National Pain Strategy, which
outlined a coordinated plan to improve healthcare delivery for patients with pain. It outlined the need for better
monitoring methods, supporting patient-centered integrated pain management practices, and improving access
to effective non-pharmacological therapies (NPT). The impact of pain in civilian health care systems is mirrored
in the military and veteran populations; both the Military Health System (MHS) and Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) populations have a higher prevalence of chronic pain compared to civilian populations.
The Medical Surveillance Monthly Report identified the top nine reasons for seeking care in the MHS outside of
pregnancy services and ill-defined symptoms. Five were related to musculoskeletal (back, knee, ankle, arm)
injuries or problems and the remaining top conditions were anxiety, mood/adjustment, and sleep disorders,
which in some cases could be comorbidities with pain.
 The present study is a renewal R01 application to advance knowledge on military readiness, opioid, and
health status outcomes associated with different early treatment trajectories of nondrug pain management
strategies in the MHS. Investigators from the SUPIC project (Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat
R01AT008404) have generated foundational knowledge about chronic pain and its behavioral health
comorbidities in the MHS. We have established a comprehensive, longitudinal database on Army members
returning deployment comprised of their MHS and VHA health encounter/claims data and several other data
sources. We have investigated the use of early NPT utilization (both complementary [e.g., chiropractic,
acupuncture, spinal manipulation, self-management, interdisciplinary pain programs] strategies and integrative
[e.g., exercise therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, mental health specialty care] strategies, and
identified there is high prevalence of opioid medications in the chronic pain cohort.
 The Specific Aims of the SUPIC renewal application are to: Aim 1: (a) Characterize early trajectories of
NPT and opioid therapies for pain management; (b) examine relationships between NPT utilization (e.g.,
specific modalities, utilization trajectories) and multidimensional outcomes (e.g., military readiness, opioid
utilization, health status); and (c) investigate the relationship of NPT trajectories and outcomes in discrete high
risk subgroups of patients (comorbid PTSD, depression) and for specific pain conditions (e.g., back pain, other
musculoskeletal, headache). Aim 2: Identify facility- and provider-level factors (FTE availability for health
occupations, propensity to refer to NPT or prescribe opioids) that explain variation in NPT use and opioid
prescribing between MHS facilities. Aim 3: (a) Describe the characteristics of SUPIC Army deployed members
with chronic pain in the MHS who do and do not transition to VHA care; (b) identify associations between NPT
receipt in the MHS and long-term health outcomes in the VHA (main effects); and (c) identify moderators and
mediators of these associations.
 This renewal grant is poised to efficiently continue much needed work on MHS pain management
approaches that will directly inform MHS and VHA leadership and facilitate informed clinical and organizational
changes. The SUPIC study population will be expanded to members of all service branches in 2013-2018
(estimated at 2 million or more) and the investigative team is expanded to strengthen our practical knowledge
and facilitate rapid translation of research findings into action. Researchers from the Defense &amp; Veterans
Center on Integrative Pain Management at the Uniformed Services University, the Department of Defense’s
Center of Excellence on pain strategies are joining the investigative team.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LARSON, MARY JO </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AI122802</grantId><grantName>Unraveling the polymodal behavior of sensory transduction receptors</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2286820.0</amount><startDate>2016-02-15</startDate><endDate>2021-01-31</endDate><keyword>Adult, 21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Affect, Alternative Splicing, Alternate Splicing, Alternative RNA Splicing, Animals, Anopheles Genus, Anopheles, Behavior, Cells, Cell Body, Child, 0-11 years old, Child Youth, Children (0-21), children, childrens', youngster, Dengue, Disease, Disorder, Drosophila genus, Drosophila, fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Family, Genes, Health, Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Physiological Homeostasis, Humidity, Insect Vectors, Insecta, Insects, Insects Invertebrates, Light, Photoradiation, Malaria, Paludism, Plasmodium Infections, Molecular Probes, Culicidae, Mosquitoes, Neurons, Nerve Cells, Nerve Unit, Neural Cell, Neurocyte, neuronal, Afferent Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Sensory Neurons, Nociceptors, Physiology, Sensory Receptors, Neural Receptors, Neuroreceptors, RNA Splicing, Splicing, Role, social role, Esthesia, Sensation, Sensitivity and Specificity, Specificity, Temperature, Temperature Sense, temperature sensation, thermoreception, Testing, Work, Mediating, promotor, promoter, Specified, Specific qualifier value, Chemicals, insight, Stimulus, gene function, Anopheles gambiae, Transient receptor potential channel, TRP channel, Sensory, interest, mutant, Isoforms, Protein Isoforms, Receptor Protein, receptor, sensory discrimination, novel, member, Basic Research, Basic Science, G Protein-Complex Receptor, G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes, GPCR, G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, Modality, Regulation, Property, response, Mediator, Mediator of Activation, Mediator of activation protein, Data, Detection, in vivo, To specify, Molecular, developmental, Development, Flies, fly, water vapor, TRPA1 Channel, transient receptor potential ankyrin, transient receptor potential channel subfamily A, TRPA channel, vector control, combinatorial, human disease, public health relevance, multi-modality, multimodality, CRISPR, CRISPR/Cas system, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, behavior response, behavioral response, genomic editing, genome editing, experiment, experimental research, experimental study, malaria mosquito, insect disease vector,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animals detect multiple kinds of stimuli, including chemicals, force, light and temperature. Distinct sensory modalities often rely on related molecular receptors2. In some cases the same receptor participates in multiple sensory modalities. How does such polymodality emerge? How can it be regulated to enable sensory discrimination? We will probe these issues by studying two classes of polymodal receptors we have identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster whose polymodality is regulated by complementary molecular mechanisms. We propose to investigate these issues in three aims. 1) We will probe the molecular mechanisms by which the activity of a receptor for both moderate warming and aversive chemicals can be regulated in a cell-specific fashion to achieve appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and use these studies to investigate the molecular basis of thermal and chemical detection in both fruit flies and Anopheles mosquitoes. 2) We will investigate how a pair of receptors act together to mediate both thermosensation and hygrosensation, and how these distinct activities are regulated to confer appropriate behavioral responses to each stimulus in both fruit flies and Anopheles mosquitoes. 3) We will test the hypothesis that multiple related receptors can function together in a combinatorial fashion to create distinct classes of sensory receptors that mediate responses to distinct sensory modalities in different sensory neurons in both fruit flies and Anopheles mosquitoes. Together, these studies will provide fundamental insights into the molecular basis of sensory receptor polymodality, how sensory receptors detect thermal and chemical stimuli, and how sensory receptor activity can be regulated to achieve appropriate sensory sensitivity and specificity.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AI113737</grantId><grantName>Design of Immunogens to Elicit PGT122 like Antibodies</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2174374.0</amount><startDate>2014-07-01</startDate><endDate>2020-06-30</endDate><keyword>Antibodies, Epitopes, Binding Determinants, Antigenic Determinants, Antigens, immunogen, ATGN, B-Lymphocytes, Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte, Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes, B-cell, B-Cells, B cells, B cell, B blood cells, Biophysics, biophysical sciences, biophysical principles, biophysical foundation, Carbohydrates, Carrier Proteins, Transporter Protein, Transport Proteins, Transport Protein Gene, Cell Culture Techniques, cell culture, Chemistry, Codon Nucleotides, Codon, Elements, Evolution, Family, Germ Lines, Glycopeptides, Goals, HIV, Virus-HIV, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus, LAV-HTLV-III, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus, AIDS Virus, HIV Antibodies, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Antibodies, LAV Antibodies, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Antibodies, HTLV-III-LAV Antibodies, HTLV-III Antibodies, HIV-Associated Antibodies, AIDS Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, gp120(HIV), gp120 ENV Glycoprotein, gp120, HTLV-III gp120, HIV env Protein gp120, HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120, HIV-1, Human immunodeficiency virus 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1, HIV1, HIV-I, Immunity, Immunization, Immunostimulation, Immunological Stimulation, Immunological Sensitization, Immunologic Stimulation, Immunologic Sensitization, Infection, Libraries, Macaca, Macaque, Mannose, Mannopyranoside, Mannopyranose, D-Mannose, Methods, Mus, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Peptides, Polysaccharides, Glycans, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Rabbits Mammals, Rabbits, Domestic Rabbit, Ribosomes, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Specificity, Technology, Testing, Vaccines, HIV vaccine, human immunodeficiency virus vaccine, HIV/AIDS Vaccines, base, Surface, Variation, Variant, Link, Ensure, insight, Individual, Collaborations, directed evolution, Directed Molecular Evolution, Peptide Library, Complex, neutralizing antibody, Viral, carbohydrate structure, success, vaccine development, vaccine formulation, development of a vaccine, develop a vaccine, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, Stretching, Structure, response, immunogenic, B-Cell Activation, Binding, Molecular Interaction, Address, Affinity, Glycobiology, Antigen Targeting, knockin mice, KI mice, Knock-in Mouse, developmental, Development, immunogenicity, designing, design, reconstitute, reconstitution, public health relevance, vaccine candidate, Antibody Response, knockin, Knock-in, nonproteinogenic amino acids, non-proteinogenic amino acids, unnatural amino acids,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extensive study of HIV+ individuals in recent years has brought to light many examples of antibodies which can neutralize a broad range of HIV strains and protect against viral challenge in animal models of infection. One particularly promising antibody family, PGT121-123, has been shown to bind to an epitope involving a combination of V3 and V1 peptide together with several glycans, possibly of both high mannose and complex type. The goal of this project is to develop immunogens which mimic these glycopeptide structures, and test their ability to elicit antibodies with broadly-neutralizing, PGT122-like specificity. Because the glycan and peptide components of the PGT122 epitope are discontinuous within the gp120 primary sequence, it is quite challenging to design a single stretch of glycopeptide which could reconstitute all of the epitope elements in their native 3D orientation. To address this challenge, our group has developed a way to design glycopeptide epitope mimics by directed evolution. In Aim 1, we will adapt this method to the evolution of glycopeptides containing two different glycans, which will be useful for incorporation of both complex- and high mannose glycans into our glycopeptide libraries. In Aim 2, we will generate a library of ~10^13 random glycopeptides, then select and amplify those which bind best to PGT122. After multiple rounds of selection/amplification we will obtain glycopeptides which are very tightly recognized by PGT122. We will also do an analogous selection to obtain glycopeptides/peptides which are recognized by germline (gl) PGT122, and all promising constructs will be biophysically and structurally characterized. In Aim 3, we will then test the immunogenicity of PGT122 epitope mimics in rabbits. To address the possibility that bnAbs may only arise by evolving from the correct precursor germline antibodies, we will also conduct immunogenicity studies with the germline-targeted immunogens. In collaboration with David Nemazee at Scripps, we will investigate the ability of these constructs to activate gl-PGT122 B cells and stimulate a gl-PGT122 antibody response in knock-in mice.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AI093459</grantId><grantName>IMPDH-targeted antibiotics for select agents</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5285650.0</amount><startDate>2011-06-01</startDate><endDate>2017-05-31</endDate><keyword>Animal Diseases, inhibitor, inhibitor/antagonist, Miscellaneous Antibiotic, Antibiotic Drugs, Antibiotic Agents, Antibiotics, anthracis, B. anthracis, Bacillus anthracis, Bacteria, Physiologic Availability, Biologic Availability, Bioavailability, Biological Availability, biowarfare, Biologic Warfare, Biological Warfare, Cause of Death, Pharmaceutic Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, virtual simulation, in silico, computerized simulation, computerized modeling, computer based models, computational simulation, computational models, computational modeling, Mathematical Models and Simulations, Mathematical Model Simulation, Computerized Models, Computer based Simulation, Computer Models, Computer Simulation, Crystallographies, Crystallography, resistant to Drug, resistance to Drug, drug resistant, Drug resistance, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Enzymes, Pasteurella tularensis, F. tularensis, Francisella tularensis, Genes, Gram-Negative Bacteria, Guanosine Phosphates, Guanine Nucleotides, Hand, Health, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, artificial immunosuppression, Immunosuppressive Therapy, Antirejection Therapy, Anti-Rejection Therapy, Therapeutic immunosuppression, Inosinic Acid Dehydrogenase, Inosine-5-Monophosphate Dehydrogenase, IMP Dehydrogenase, Infection, L. monocytogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Malleus, Nucleotides, living system, Organism, Parasites, Permeability, Pseudomonas mallei, P.mallei, P. mallei, B. mallei, Burkholderia mallei, S.aureus, S. aureus, Staphylococcus aureus, Testing, Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase, Folic Acid Reductase, EC 1.5.1.3, Dihydrofolate Dehydrogenase, Dihydrofolate Reductase, Trimpex, Proloprim, 2,4-Pyrimidinediamine, 5-((3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methyl)-, Trimethoprim, C. parvum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Left, Variation, Variant, Series, uptake, antibacterial, anti-bacterial, Antibacterial Agents, Anti-Bacterial Agents, viral infectious disease treatment, Antiviral Therapy, Therapeutic, Metabolic, Acinetobacter baumannii, programs, Source, model organism, Animal Models and Related Studies, Animal Model, microbial, Toxicities, Toxic effect, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Categories, LOINC Axis 2 Property, Property, anticancer therapy, Malignant Neoplasm Treatment, Malignant Neoplasm Therapy, Cancer Treatment, cancer therapy, Nucleotide Biosynthesis, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, Methicillin Resistant S.

IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) presents a similar therapeutic opportunity. Although IMPDH inhibitors are used in immunosuppressive, cancer and antiviral therapy, as yet IMPDH inhibitors have not been exploited in antibacterial applications because no bacterial-selective IMPDH inhibitors have been identified. We have been engaged in a medicinal chemistry program to develop IMPDH-targeted drugs for treating the category B parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. We have 'in hand' low nanomolar inhibitors of C. parvum IMPDH (CpIMPDH) with &gt;250 selectivity versus the human enzymes. Surprisingly, CpIMPDH is most closely related to bacterial IMPDHs, suggesting that C. parvum obtained this gene via horizontal transfer. We have identified a structural motif that defines susceptible enzymes; this motif is found in a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria, including seven other select agents. We propose a program to develop the CpIMPDH inhibitors as broader spectrum antibiotics. To this end, we will determine the efficacy of the CpIMPDH inhibitors against a panel of pathogenic bacteria chosen to define the spectrum of action in terms of the structural variation of the target enzyme and the permeability of the bacteria (select agents in bold): Bacillus anthracis (Gram positive), Francisella tularensis (Gram-negative facultative intracellular), Listeria monocytogenes (Gram- positive facultative intracellular), Burkholderia mallei/pseudomallei (Gram-negative facultative intracellular), Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Acinetobacter baumannii (Gram-negative). These pathogens pose some of the most serious threats to human health; B. anthracis, Bu. mallei/pseudomallei, and F. tularensis are top priorities for countermeasure development and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and A. baumannii present major treatment challenges.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HEDSTROM, LIZBETH K.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AI090745</grantId><grantName>Glycoantigen evolution targeting antibodies of the PGT 128 lineage</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>3892218.0</amount><startDate>2010-06-01</startDate><endDate>2023-11-30</endDate><keyword>Amino Acids, aminoacid, Antibodies, Monoclonal Antibodies, Clinical Treatment Moab, mAbs, Epitopes, Antigenic Determinants, Binding Determinants, Antigens, immunogen, Award, B-Lymphocytes, B blood cells, B cell, B cells, B-Cells, B-cell, Biophysics, biophysical foundation, biophysical principles, biophysical sciences, Cell Culture Techniques, cell culture, cell cultures, Cells, Cell Body, Elements, Evolution, Glycopeptides, Goals, Health, HIV, AIDS Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, LAV-HTLV-III, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus, Virus-HIV, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120, HIV env Protein gp120, HTLV-III gp120, gp120, gp120 ENV Glycoprotein, gp120(HIV), HIV Infections, HTLV-III Infections, HTLV-III-LAV Infections, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections, Human, Modern Man, Hybridomas, Immunization, Immunologic Sensitization, Immunologic Stimulation, Immunological Sensitization, Immunological Stimulation, Immunostimulation, Infection, Libraries, Macaca mulatta, M mulatta, M. mulatta, Rhesus Macaque, Rhesus Monkey, Mannose, D-Mannose, Mannopyranose, Mannopyranoside, Methods, Mus, Mice, Mice Mammals, Murine, Patients, Peptides, Glycans, Polysaccharides, Domestic Rabbit, Rabbits, Rabbits Mammals, Oryctolagus cuniculus, mRNA, Messenger RNA, Specificity, Testing, Virus, Site, Surface, Phase, Variant, Variation, Evaluation, Individual, Collaborations, directed evolution, Directed Molecular Evolution, Immunological response, host response, immune system response, immunoresponse, Immune response, tool, scaffolding, scaffold, Complex, Event, Protocol, Protocols documentation, Techniques, neutralizing antibody, Viral, develop a vaccine, develop vaccines, development of a vaccine, vaccine development, cohort, Animal Models and Related Studies, model of animal, model organism, Animal Model, Structure, response, Molecular Interaction, Binding, polypeptide, Affinity, Knock-in Mouse, KI mice, knockin mice, Monitor, deep sequencing, immunogenicity, design, designing, vaccination strategy, immunization strategy, reconstitution, reconstitute, B cell repertoire, Regimen, Antibody Response, Knock-in, knockin, experimental study, experiment, experimental research,</keyword><description>Project Summary/Abstract
Extensive study of HIV+ individuals in recent years has brought to light many examples of antibodies that
can neutralize a broad range of HIV strains and protect against viral challenge in animal models of
infection. The portion of viral surface most commonly targeted by such antibodies is now known to be
the “high-mannose patch”: among patients producing broadly-neutralizing antibodies, 38% target this
one region of the virus. One of the most potent high mannose patch antibodies, PGT128, binds to a
particular arrangement of high-mannose glycans and conserved peptide residues. Our goal is to develop
vaccine immunogens which mimic this arrangement precisely and be used to elicit PGT128-like
antibodies.
Our approach will utilize unique directed evolution methods to develop glycoimmunogens in which
PGT128 epitope elements are correctly reconstituted. It is also possible that additional immunogens will
be required to correctly prime the immune response by stimulating germline precursors of PGT128.
Therefore, we will develop glycopeptides targeting both mature and germline PGT128 antibodies. In
collaboration with David Nemazee at Scripps, we will investigate the ability of these glycopeptides in
combination, to activate a germline PGT128 response that can mature into a response with broadly-
neutralizing PGT128-like specificity.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KRAUSS, ISAAC JONATHAN</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AG038375</grantId><grantName>Aging &amp; Accurate Face Impressions: Perceptual, Neural &amp; Motivational Mechanisms</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2143295.0</amount><startDate>2011-05-01</startDate><endDate>2017-04-30</endDate><keyword>Age, senior citizen, over 65 Elderly, older person, older adult, later life, late life, geriatric, elders, advanced age, Aged 65 and Over, Elderly, Aging, angry, angers, Anger, Counseling, Cues, dietary, Diet, Hydroxytyramine, 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-1,2-benzenediol, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenethylamine, Dopamine, Emotions, facial, faces, Face, Fraud, Goals, Health, Hostility, Intelligence, Literature, lifespan, life span, Length of Life, Longevity, Methods, Motivation, Persons, Neurosciences, well-being, Personal Satisfaction, Public Health, public health medicine (field), Research, Social Interaction, Testing, Time, visual cortical, Visual Cortex, adaptive behavior, adaptation behavior, Adaptive Behaviors, Competence, Variation, Variant, psychological, psychologic, Stimulus, Visual, young adulthood, adult youth, young adult, Fostering, Ethnicity, Ethnic Origin, Ethnicity aspects, fMRI, Functional MRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, programs, expression of emotion, emotional expression, showing emotion, interest, impression, contagion, neural, relating to nervous system, trait, Structure, Agreement, Categories, age difference, Appearance, neural function, Neurophysiology - biologic function, social, Emotional, response, face perception, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Brain region, distraction, Address, fitness, Cognitive, Process, sex, Behavioral, age dependent, age related, aging effect, age effect, Coupled, psychopharmacological, psychopharmacologic, aging brain, affective neuroscience, emotion regulation, treatment development, intervention development, develop therapy, therapy development, information processing,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successful aging is a crucial public health challenge. Because accurate trait impressions from faces provide a significant guide to adaptive social interactions, ameliorating any age-related declines in accuracy is integral to addressing that challenge, and this is the long range goal of the proposed research. Accurate assessments of traits like health, hostility, honesty, and competence are important for avoiding contagion and physical harm and seeking appropriate counsel across the lifespan. Yet, there is a dearth of research investigating the accuracy of older adults' (OA) impressions of these traits despite reason to expect age-related decrements. Young adults' (YA) trait impressions are influenced by overgeneralized responses to facial qualities that provide useful information about social interaction possibilities. More specifically, YA tend to generalize their adaptive responses to facial qualities that mark babies, low fitness, or emotion expressions to people whose facial structure merely resembles babies (babyface overgeneralization), low fitness (anomalous face overgeneralization) or an emotion expression (emotion face overgeneralization). Moreover, generalizing from negative facial qualities, including resemblance to an angry face or an anomalous face, fosters accurate trait impressions, whereas generalizing from positive facial qualities, such as high attractiveness or resemblance to a happy face or a baby's face does not. A separate body of research reveals that OA are worse than YA at recognizing negative emotion expressions, including anger, and less responsive than YA to other negatively valenced stimuli, whereas there is little age difference in recognition of happy expressions or response to positively valenced stimuli. The utility of negatively valenced facial cues for achieving accurate impressions coupled with evidence that OA may be less sensitive to such cues motivates the specific aims of the proposed research. Nine studies use behavioral, neural, and psychopharmacological methods to determine whether: 1) OA and YA show more agreement in trait impressions of faces that vary in positivity (medium to positively valenced cues) than those that vary in negativity (medium to negatively valenced cues); 2) OA show less accurate trait impressions than YA; and whether age differences in trait impressions from faces are influenced by 3) decreased dopamine function in OA; 4) greater emotion regulation in OA; 5) more selective processing of personally relevant faces in OA; and 6) more visual dedifferentiation in OA. By integrating research on trait impressions from faces in YA with research on age-related changes in neural function, motivation, and information processing to achieve these specific aims, the proposed research will contribute to understanding when and why impressions change with age as well as what factors contribute to accurate trait impressions at any age. The findings will advance the fields of aging as well as social affective neuroscience, with implications for the development of interventions to reduce age-related vulnerabilities to maladaptive social interactions that can have negative physical, financial, or psychological repercussions.</description><investigator><investigatorId>ZEBROWITZ, LESLIE A.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R01AG019714</grantId><grantName>Hearing Acuity, Cognitive Aging, and Memory for Speech</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2498902.0</amount><startDate>2001-07-01</startDate><endDate>2019-05-31</endDate><keyword>adulthood, Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Affect, Age, senior citizen, over 65 Elderly, older person, older adult, later life, late life, geriatric, elders, advanced age, Aged 65 and Over, Elderly, Aging, Communication, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, facial, faces, Face, Family, Goals, sound perception, hearing perception, Hearing, Language, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Memory, working memory, Shortterm Memory, Immediate Memory, Short-Term Memory, age related hearing loss, Presbyacusis, Presbycusis, Research, Research Resources, Resources, Semantics, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Social isolation, Social Service, Social Work, Speech, Testing, Work, Friends, Healthcare, health care, Outcomes Research, Comprehension, improved, Chronic, Medical, Compensation, Financial compensation, Failure, memory dysfunction, Memory Deficit, Memory impairment, young adulthood, adult youth, young adult, Knowledge, programs, Sensory, Pattern, early detection, Early Diagnosis, Performance, success, heuristics, knowledgebase, knowledge base, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, social, theories, executive control, executive function, Provider, Effectiveness, Hypoacusis, Hypoacuses, Hearing Loss, hearing impairment, Cognitive, Process, age dependent, age related, designing, design, Expectancy, Population, Cognitive aging, aging brain, language comprehension, comprehending language, comprehension deficit,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, with the number of adults age 65 or older expected to grow to 70.3 million in 2030. Among this group, hearing loss is the third most prevalent chronic medical condition, with some 40-45% of adults over the age of 65 showing some degree of hearing impairment, rising to 83% in the population over the age of 70. Although considerable progress has been made in both audition and cognitive aging research, hearing loss has primarily been considered as an independent issue. This competing renewal builds on ten years of research investigating sensory-cognitive interactions as they affect spoken language comprehension and memory in adult aging. A major concern of both theoretical and practical importance is that even with a mild hearing loss, the perceptual effort older adults must expend on decoding a degraded speech signal will draw attentional resources that would otherwise be available for higher-level sentence comprehension and encoding what has been heard in memory. As such, a memory or comprehension deficit in many older adults may have an unrealized sensory origin. We propose a program of research to elucidate the mechanisms that may underlie the effect of perceptual effort on comprehension and memory for spoken information. We test a hypothesis that acuity-related listening effort, along with age-related changes in working memory and executive function, lead to a qualitative change in how sentences and discourse are processed, with results that can lead to both comprehension successes and failures. Successful outcome of this research will advance our understanding of cognitive aging at the level of theory, but also with implications for improving communicative effectiveness in older adulthood.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WINGFIELD, ARTHUR </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R00MH100284</grantId><grantName>Hippocampal-prefrontal interactions underlying learning and memory</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>744718.0</amount><startDate>2013-04-01</startDate><endDate>2017-04-30</endDate><keyword>abstracting, Affect, Animals, Anxiety, Behavior, psychological disorder, psychiatric illness, mental illness, Psychiatric Disorder, Psychiatric Disease, Mental health disorders, Mental disorders, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Cognition, Communication, data interpretation, Data Analysis, Data Analyses, Decision Making, depression, Mental Depression, Disorder, Disease, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Environment, frontal cortex, frontal lobe, Goals, Grant, High Frequency Oscillation, hippocampal, Hippocampus, Cornu Ammonis, Ammon Horn, Hippocampus (Brain), Learning, Photoradiation, Light, Memory, working memory, Shortterm Memory, Immediate Memory, Short-Term Memory, Mentors, Mentorship, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, neurophysiological, neurophysiology, Professional Positions, Jobs, Occupations, Physiology, Play, career skill, Professional Competence, Research, Researchers, Investigators, Research Personnel, Research Resources, Resources, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Rodent, social role, Role, schizophrenic, dementia praecox, Schizophrenic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Sleep, traumatic neurosis, Posttraumatic Stress Disorders, Posttraumatic Neuroses, Post-Traumatic Neuroses, PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders, Teaching, Educational process of instructing, Testing, Time, Work, Writing, symposium, symposia, summit, convention, conference, Mediating, Prefrontal Cortex, base, improved, Medial, Site, Clinical, Phase, Physiologic, Physiological, Link, Training, awake, Delta Wave sleep, Delta Wave, Slow-Wave Sleep, Workshop, Educational workshop, Funding, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Functional disorder, Nature, Knowledge, cognitive function, Investigation, Complex, Clinic, Pattern, Techniques, interest, post-doctoral, post-doc, Research Associate, Postdoc, Postdoctoral Fellow, experience, Performance, professor, neural, relating to nervous system, Structure, skills, memory process, memory retrieval, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Position, Positioning Attribute, career development, Brain region, Address, Detection, Retrieval, Process, developmental, Development, behavioral impairment, impaired behavior, effective therapy, effective treatment, neural patterning, neuronal patterning, optogenetics, cognitive process, memory consolidation, tenure track, tenure process, job market,</keyword><description>Project Summary / Abstract
Research
The ability to form memories and use past experience to guide behavior is one of the most remarkable
capacities of the nervous system. Multiple brain regions interact with each other to support the complex
cognitive processes of learning and decision-making, and the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC)
play important roles in these processes. The hippocampus is necessary for rapid episodic learning and
memory, while PFC is crucial for memory consolidation and retrieval, and for cognitive functions like decision-
making and working memory. How these structures interact with each other to support behavior is still poorly
understood. Further, neural activity in the hippocampus and PFC is implicated in numerous psychiatric
disorders, including PTSD, depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. My long-term goal is to understand the
physiological bases of hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during behavior, and dysfunction in these processes
in pathological states. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the nature and role of hippocampal-PFC
interactions mediated by a particular neural pattern of activity, awake sharp wave ripples (SWRs), in learning
and memory-guided decision making. First, I will use multisite multielectrode recordings in the hippocampus
and PFC in awake behaving animals during learning to test the hypothesis that memory replay in the
hippocampus during awake SWRs activates mnemonic patterns in PFC. Second, I will take advantage of a
novel technique for real-time detection and disruption of awake SWRs to investigate if awake SWRs are
required for formation of stable memory patterns in PFC. Finally, I will determine the causal role of
hippocampal-PFC interactions during awake SWRs in memory-guided decision making by using optogenetic
inhibition of PFC activity contingent on real-time detection of awake SWRs during behavior. These experiments
will advance our understanding of propagation of mnemonic activity between the hippocampus and PFC and
provide direct and causal evidence linking physiological phenomena to behavior.
Candidate
My broad interests are in understanding the neurophysiological basis of behavior. My long-term goal is to
become an independent investigator with a lab that focuses on investigating how different brain structures
interact with each other to support complex cognitive processes such as learning and decision-making, and
understanding how dysfunction in these processes leads to pathological states in disease. I want to use a
combination of techniques, including electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals, real-time detection
and manipulation of physiological patterns, and perturbation of neural activity in specific circuits during
behavior, to determine causal links between physiological phenomena and behavior. During the training phase
of this application, I will gain additional skills in conceptual, technical and career development aspects which
will enable me to make a successful transition to an independent position with my own research group. My
short-term goals are, 1) to improve my knowledge about pre-frontal cortex (PFC) physiology and to gain
expertise in multi-site recordings in the hippocampus and PFC, 2) to acquire further proficiency in data
analyses skills, 3) to gain expertise in simultaneous optogenetic manipulations and physiology in awake-
behaving rodents, 4) to improve my knowledge in the clinical aspects of my research, 5) to obtain an
independent tenure-track assistant professor position and transfer to the R00 portion of this proposal within 2
years, and 6) to successfully obtain R01 funding within 5 years of this proposal.
Environment
• The vibrant, collaborative research environment at UCSF is conducive to the attainment of these goals. My
 co-mentors and consultants have extensive experience in prefrontal physiology and optogenetics, and also
 in the pathophysiology of hippocampal and prefrontal disorders. Through my co-mentorship and consultants,
 I also have access to UCSF's Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center, which will aid in these research
goals.
• UCSF also offers academic courses that I will utilize to gain these research skills. UCSF provides a number
 of career development resources to help postdoctoral fellows gain additional skills required to achieve
 independence, which include seminars and classes aimed at preparing postdocs for the academic job
 market and a dedicated resource that helps postdocs apply for academic jobs. I will utilize all these
 resources to enhance my career skills.
• I will present my scientific work in conferences and regularly in departmental seminars. I will also attend
 grant writing, lab management and teaching workshops offered at UCSF.</description><investigator><investigatorId>JADHAV, SHANTANU P</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>R00GM111978</grantId><grantName>Functional diversification of the HD-superfamily; the Hydrolase/Oxygenase Dilemma</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>743052.2</amount><startDate>2014-09-05</startDate><endDate>2019-04-30</endDate><keyword>absorption, Affect, inhibitor/antagonist, inhibitor, Antibiotics, Miscellaneous Antibiotic, Antibiotic Drugs, Antibiotic Agents, Antiviral Agents, anti-virals, anti-viral drugs, anti-viral agents, Antivirals, Antiviral Drugs, Biological Assay, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Crystallization, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, type one diabetes, type I diabetes, ketosis prone diabetes, juvenile diabetes mellitus, juvenile diabetes, insulin dependent diabetes, Type I Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 diabetes, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, T1DM, T1D, T1 diabetes, T1 DM, Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus, Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus, IDDM, Brittle Diabetes Mellitus, DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, Environment, Enzymes, Enzyme Gene, Family, Freezing, Glycine, Aminoacetic Acid, Health, HIV, Virus-HIV, Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus, LAV-HTLV-III, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus, AIDS Virus, HIV-1, Human immunodeficiency virus 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1, HIV1, HIV-I, Human, Modern Man, Hydrolase, Hydrolase Gene, Hydrolase Family Gene, Hydrolysis, Inositol, Mesoinositol, Chiro-Inositol, Kinetics, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Metalloproteins, Metals, Methods, Nucleotidases, nucleotide phosphohydrolase, nucleotidase, deoxyinosine-activated nucleotidase, cytosolic deoxyribonucleotide-activated nucleotidase, DA-nucleotidase, Nucleotides, Oxidation-Reduction, oxidation reduction reaction, Redox, Oxygen, O2 element, O element, Oxygenases, Periodicity, Rhythmicity, Cyclicity, inorganic phosphate, Phosphates, phosphoric diester hydrolase, Phosphodiesterases, Phosphorus, Phosphorous, P element, Play, Proteins, RNA, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA Gene Products, Non-Polyadenylated RNA, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Mass Spectrum Analysis, Mass Spectrum Analyses, Mass Spectrum, Mass Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis, Time, Work, inositol oxygenase, myo-inositol oxygenase, Measures, Mutagenesis, Mutagenesis Molecular Biology, Genetics-Mutagenesis, Competence, Mediating, Titrations, Protein Domains, Peptide Domain, Tertiary Protein Structure, base, cofactor, Phase, Physiologic, Physiological, Biochemical, Series, Active Sites, biosynthesis, Anabolism, Chemicals, insight, Measurement, analog, Funding, uptake, phosphonate, Descriptor, Immune response, immunoresponse, host response, Immunological response, Therapeutic Agents, Cleaved cell, cleaved, Complications of Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetic Complications, Diabetes-Related Complications, Diabetes Complications, Nature, Life, Adopted, Event, Reaction, microorganism, Source, Techniques, Viral, Nuclear, Marines, Mono-S, MonoS, chemical reaction, divalent metal, metalloenzyme, Structure, novel, member, Catabolism, Property, Huntington gene, interesting transcript 15, IT15 gene, Huntingtin, HD Gene, Bioinformatics, Bio-Informatics, Binding, Molecular Interaction, structural genomics, Electron Transport Complex III, Ubiquinone-Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase, Ubiquinol-ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Ubihydroquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase, QH(2)-Ferricytochrome-c Oxidoreductase, QH(2)-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Dihydroubiquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase, Complex III, Coenzyme QH2-Cytochrome-c Reductase, Coenzyme Q-Cytochrome-c Reductase, small molecule, Address, Degradation Pathway, Degradative Pathway, Mononuclear, Phylogenetics, Phylogenetic Analysis, Monitor, Molecular, overexpress, over-expression, overexpression, public health relevance, screening, experimental research, experiment, experimental study,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HD-domain proteins constitute a novel superfamily of metalloenzymes that counts presently more than 37,000 members in all three domains of life. Though there are generally annotated as as (phospho)hydrolases their functions are mostly unknown. Less than a decade ago, a novel diiron HD enzyme involved in the catabolism of inositol and associated with type I diabetes mellitus, namely myo-inositol oxygenase was demonstrated to carry out a radically different reaction using molecular oxygen to afford activation of its substrate. The only recently identified HD enzyme PhnZ, was also shown to follow the paradigm of MIOX, employing oxygen for the conversion of an organophosphonate to phosphate by marine microorganisms. The mechanism and structure of the reactive intermediates are presently unknown, but their mechanistic striking similarity to other nonheme Fe enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, invoke questions about the function of these enzymes and their possible implications on human health and environment. For this purpose, the first part of the project will focus on the characterization of PhnZ. This entails a combination of spectroscopic, structural, redox and activity studies so as to establish the modus operandii of such novel oxygenases. The substrate-free and bound forms of the enzyme will be studied so as to obtain for the first time combined structural and electronic information about the
'on' and 'off' reactive states for which crystallographic information has been extremely challenging, how substrate or inhibitors tune and affect the properties of the active site of the enzyme. This information will set the grounds for the discovery of compounds that can activate and inhibit these enzymes, therefore providing powerful control over their function. In addition to, the characterization of downstream events in the chemical reactions will likely establish the common strategy that specific nonheme Fe enzymes (mononuclear or dinuclear) adopt to carry out difficult and environmentally important reactions. The second part of the project aims at mapping the catalytic landscape of (dinuclear) HD domain enzymes, discovery of new functions and identifying the type and the role of metals in modulating specific activities (hydrolysis vs oxygenation). For this purpose, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis new attractive protein targets of unknown function have been identified. Selected protein will be overexpressed and purified. These will be spectroscopically characterized with a combination of EPR, Mössbauer, crystallographic and NMR techniques. A profile of their activities will be established by screening activities for specific substrates and mass spectrometry methods. Presently there are a handful of HD domain enzymes implicated in immunoresponse, such as restriction factors for HIV-1 or nucleotidases attacking viral nucleotides that have come into the scientific focus. Their function is not completely understood, whereas the presence of one or two metals is not known whether it is functional, structural or co-catalytic. This work will begin during the K99 funding period and will continue during the independent phase and will attempt to study these enzymes and draw the molecular background of their function (hydrolytic vs oxygenation). The long-range purpose of this second phase of the project is to establish on the basis of bioinformatics, crystallographic, mutagenesis and activity studies the determinants directing distinct functions within the HD superfamily that will ultimately lead to the identification new antiviral factors and
therapeutic agents as well as the discovery of novel oxygenases implicated in chemically difficult small molecule transformations.</description><investigator><investigatorId>PANDELIA, MARIA-EIRINI </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>P30DA035772</grantId><grantName>Center to Improve System Performance of Substance Use Disorder Treatment</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>5050654.0</amount><startDate>2015-07-01</startDate><endDate>2027-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Attention, Decision Making, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drugs, Medication, Pharmaceutic Preparations, drug/agent, Environment, Fertilization, Fertility/Fertilization, Goals, Health, Healthcare Systems, Health Care Systems, Health Services Research, Health Services Evaluation, Medical Care Research, services research, Joints, Leadership, Learning, Managed Care Programs, Managed Health Care Insurance Plans, managed care insurance, managed care plan, managed healthcare insurance plans, Medicaid, Mentors, Methods, Persons, Paper, Pharmacies, Pharmacy facility, Primary Care, Primary Healthcare, Primary Health Care, Private Sector, Privatization, Public Health, Research, Study Type, study design, Research Design, Investigators, Researchers, Research Personnel, Research Resources, Resources, social role, Role, Science, Specialty, medical specialties, Substance Use Disorder, Time, Translating, Work, ranpirnase, P-30 Protein, P30, P30 Protein, Managed Care, Caring, base, career, improved, Site, Training, Individual, Policy Maker, Policies, Interdisciplinary Research, Multidisciplinary Collaboration, Multidisciplinary Research, Interdisciplinary Study, Measurement, R-Series Research Projects, R01 Mechanism, R01 Program, Research Grants, Research Projects, Research Project Grants, Collaborations, Nature, Knowledge, programs, Clinic, System, Services, Emergency Department, Emergency room, Accident and Emergency department, American, experience, Performance, Stretching, payment, Modeling, QOC, Quality of Care, Provider, Effectiveness, telehealth, Improve Access, Enrollment, enroll, Process, Development, developmental, beneficiary, cost, design, designing, next generation, innovation, innovate, innovative, multidisciplinary, racial and ethnic, ethnoracial, patient oriented, patient centered, addiction, addictive disorder, lens, lenses, opioid use disorder, opiate use disorder, ethnic diversity, ethnically diverse, treatment services, health plan, health plans, bundled payment, service delivery,</keyword><description>This Core Center of Excellence application (P30) for the renewal of the Brandeis/Harvard Center to Improve
System Performance of Substance Use Disorder Treatment proposes to enhance the effectiveness and
impact of existing research on delivery and payment of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services, and
offer a national resource for those researching and designing SUD treatment systems and policy in the context
of ongoing, dramatic changes in the US health care system. The Center’s goal is to conduct and extend
research on service delivery and payment to synergistically expand the research base, informing policy and
practice decisions that will profoundly affect the cost, quality, and availability of SUD services. The intertwined
nature of delivery and payment systems requires attention to both in order to achieve sustainability of high
value systems innovations. While continuing to emphasize innovations in delivery and payment systems
broadly defined, the proposed renewal will also bring intentional focus to low-barrier settings for treatment (i.e.,
wholly outside of or extensions of specialty SUD settings such as emergency departments, pharmacies, and
telehealth), as well as quality improvement, inequities in the provision and financing of services, and factors
that influence sustainability of innovation. The renewal also will expand the science around Medicaid managed
care, given the importance of Medicaid as a payer of SUD services, and the dominant role of private Medicaid
health plans. The Center will build on three Component research projects, as well as related research at
Brandeis, Harvard and elsewhere, and support the development of new research to provide crucial and timely
evidence that can inform the design and implementation of effective policy and practice. The Administrative,
Research, Policy/Dissemination, and Pilot/Mentoring Cores provide the organizational engine to promote
cross-fertilization of findings across projects to support the Center’s aims: 1) advance the science by
conducting and stimulating research and knowledge development about payment and delivery system
innovation for SUD treatment; 2) drive the next generation of research by mentoring and training a
racially/ethnically diverse pool of early career investigators and creating networks of early career and senior
researchers; and, 3) engage with key stakeholders in a bidirectional exchange to produce timely and relevant
research that informs and influences policy and practice. The Center will achieve these aims by extending the
research base to include critical analyses of timely and emerging topics identified in close collaboration with
key stakeholders. We will do this through activities that include empirical and conceptual papers; short- and
longer-term analyses targeted at pressing issues for policy and practice; and multiple mentoring programs and
activities to support early career investigators. Further, we will translate and disseminate findings to an
expansive audience of policy makers, payers, providers, persons with lived experience of SUD, and
researchers to inform the changing environment of delivery and payment of SUD treatment services.</description><investigator><investigatorId>REIF, SHARON </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>P30AG048785</grantId><grantName>Boston Roybal Center for Active Lifestyle Interventions</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>4540713.0</amount><startDate>2014-09-30</startDate><endDate>2024-05-31</endDate><keyword>21+ years old, Adult Human, adulthood, Adult, advanced age, elders, geriatric, late life, later life, older adult, older person, senior citizen, Elderly, Aging, Behavior Conditioning Therapy, Behavior Modification, Behavior Treatment, Behavioral Conditioning Therapy, Behavioral Modification, Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Treatment, Conditioning Therapy, behavior intervention, behavioral intervention, Behavior Therapy, Boston, Clinical Trials, Control Groups, Disease, Disorder, Faculty, Foundations, Future, Goals, Grant, Health, Health Promotion, Salutogenesis, promoting health, Maintenance, Mentors, Methods, middle age, mid life, mid-life, middle aged, midlife, Motivation, Persons, United States National Institutes of Health, NIH, National Institutes of Health, Personal Satisfaction, well-being, wellbeing, Pilot Projects, pilot study, Psychosocial Factor, psychosocial variables, Race, Races, racial, racial background, racial origin, Research, Research Personnel, Investigators, Researchers, Resources, Research Resources, Safety, Science, Testing, Time, Translating, translation, Translations, United States Veterans Administration, Veterans Administration, Veterans Affairs, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Work, Writing, Measures, Research Methodology, Research Methods, research and methods, Task Forces, advisory team, Advisory Committees, Prefrontal Cortex, human subject, improved, Procedures, Left, Cranial, Cephalic, Area, sedentary, Phase, Link, Ensure, Physical activity, Discipline, Individual, Groups at risk, People at risk, Persons at risk, Populations at Risk, Funding, Ethnicity, Ethnic Origin, Collaborations, randomized control trial, Randomized, Controlled Trials, tool, Knowledge, Protocol, Protocols documentation, psychosocial, behavior change, meetings, meeting, Postdoctoral Fellow, Postdoc, Research Associate, post-doc, post-doctoral, post-doctoral trainee, research associates, experience, success, knowledge base, novel, Basic Science, Basic Research, behavior test, behavioral test, social, Emotional, Modeling, Intervention, Intervention Strategies, interventional strategy, executive function, executive control, Vulnerable Populations, vulnerable group, vulnerable people, Institution, Address, Adherence, Behavioral Mechanisms, Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change, behavior mechanism, Data, Applications Grants, Grant Proposals, Reproducibility, Ancillary Study, Cognitive, Monitor, Process, Development, developmental, Behavioral, pilot trial, design, designing, efficacy evaluation, efficacy analysis, efficacy assessment, efficacy examination, evaluate efficacy, examine efficacy, Outcome, Population, lifestyle intervention, life style intervention, innovation, innovate, innovative, healthy aging, high risk, evidence base, doctoral student, Ph D student, Ph D. student, Ph.

Center for Active Lifestyle Interventions (RALI Boston) will address its overarching goal to develop and test
behavior change strategies that increase physical activity and promote healthy aging, especially for persons at
high risk for poor health outcomes. The Pilot Core will achieve this goal by supporting a group of innovative
and scientifically rigorous clinical trials by pilot investigators who will enhance our knowledge base, develop
novel research methodologies and tools, disseminate our results, and ultimately work collaboratively to
develop the pilot data and experience necessary to conduct future full-scale translational interventions using
clinical trials. The specific aims of the Core are: 1) to solicit, select, and support two to three of the most
meritorious pilot studies submitted to us each year to develop and test novel multicomponent strategies to
promote behavioral changes that advance the science and result in improved health and well-being for older
people; 2) to oversee and support the progress of pilot investigators and their projects and provide resources
to assure their success in testing the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of behavioral interventions guided by
the NIH Stage Model; 3) to apply the research findings from the pilot projects to design translational projects and
work with investigators to seek additional funding to develop and test them at different phases of the NIH Stage
Model; 4) to implement procedures to assure the scientific integrity, rigor and reproducibility of our research and
the safety of human subjects. The Pilot Core Leaders (Drs. Margie Lachman, Lewis Lipsitz and Theresa Ellis)
will work closely with the Management and Administrative Core to ensure the Center operates smoothly and
fulfills its aims. Procedures are in place to solicit, review and support new pilot projects. The pilot projects will
draw on the most promising recent evidence linking psychosocial, behavioral, cognitive, and neuroscientific
factors to health and to explore mechanisms involved in motivation and behavior change. Two pilot studies are
proposed for the initial period of this renewal application to examine the efficacy of enhancing both motivation
and executive control, two processes that have shown promise in engendering increased physical activity in
sedentary individuals. One pilot is a randomized controlled trial that will test the feasibility and effects of a 10-
session transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex on adherence to a personalized physical activity goal in physically-inactive older adults without overt
illness or disease. The second pilot will examine the effects of two psychosocial factors, positive messaging
and self-affirmation, on motivation and engagement in physical activity and their maintenance over time,
compared to a control group that receives only positive messaging. Results of these studies will be used to
develop new interventions for testing in larger scale clinical trials. The pilot core will continue to oversee the
development of novel pilot studies and the translation and dissemination of findings from the Center.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LACHMAN, MARGIE E</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>P01NS079419</grantId><grantName>HOMEOSTATIC REGULATION OF NEOCORTICAL INHIBITION</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>6197926.0</amount><startDate>2013-09-28</startDate><endDate>2019-06-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders, Intracranial CNS Disorders, Encephalon Diseases, Brain Disorders, Brain Diseases, Subcellular Process, Cellular Process, Cellular Physiology, Cellular Function, Cell Process, Cell Function, Cell physiology, Cell Body, Cells, Complement Proteins, Complement, Disorder, Disease, Site-Specific DNA-methyltransferase, Modification Methylases, Dnmt, DNA-Methyltransferases, DNA Modification Methyltransferases, DNA Methyltransferase, DNA Modification Methylases, electrophysiological, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Enzyme Gene, Enzymes, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Epilepsy, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, Genes, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, Infant, Interneurons, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Methods, Methylation, Mus, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Parvalbumins, Physiology, Reagent, Messenger RNA, mRNA, Rodent, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Role, social role, Schizophrenia, schizophrenic, dementia praecox, Schizophrenic Disorders, Signal Pathway, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Synapses, synapse, Synaptic, Transcription, RNA Expression, Gene Transcription, Genetic Transcription, AMPA Receptors, Forebrain, Fore-Brain, Prosencephalon, Telefax, Fax, Telefacsimile, Mediating, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, DNQX, neopallium, isocortex, homotypical cortex, Neocortex, Site, Chronic, Physiologic, Physiological, juvenile human, juvenile, Adolescent Youth, Adolescent, Genetic, DNA Methylation, postnatal, Sensory, Pattern, receptor, Receptor Protein, Neuregulin 1, Sensory And Motor Neuron-Derived Factor, NRG1 Protein, NRG1 Gene Product, NDF Protein, Breast Cancer Cell Differentiation Factor P45, Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity, Structure, novel, Neuregulins, Sensory-and-motor-derived factor, Neu-Differentiation Factor, NRG Proteins, Code, Coding System, ErbB4 gene, NDF/Heregulin Receptor Gene, HER4, HER-4, ErbB4, ErbB-4, neural circuit, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, Regulation, response, Dicer Enzyme, MicroRNAs, miRNAs, miRNA, Micro RNA, developmental disease/disorder, developmental disorder, prevent, preventing, Small RNA, autism spectrum disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, Receptor Signaling, Subgroup, Epigenetic Mechanism, Epigenetic Change, Epigenetic, Epigenetic Process, Slice, Transcript, Monitor, Molecular, Knockout, Knock-out, developmental, Development, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, Instruction, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, excitatory neuron, inhibitory neuron, Population, Impairment, neocortical, critical period, optogenetics, transcriptome sequencing, RNAseq, RNA sequencing, RNA Seq, Genomic DNA, gDNA, bisulfite sequencing, bisulfite-seq, BS-seq, Array tomography, experimental study, experimental research, experiment,</keyword><description> (See instructions): 
Homeostatic regulation of inhibition is a fundamental problem faced by many neural circuits. 
However, the rules governing homeostasis of inhibitoty neurons may differ from those operating in 
excitatory neurons, since the inhibitory neurons must he regulated, not only by their own firing, but 
by the overall level of actirity in the circuit. Altered homeostatic regulation of inhibition has been 
implicated in brain disorders including schizophrenia, autism and autism spectrum disorders and 
epilepsy. Furthermore, genes implicated in these disorders have potent actions on specific subtypes 
of cortical interneurons, but the relationships between these pathways and homeostatic regulation 
of actirity are incompletely understood. We vrill investigate the role of DNA methylation in 
regulating the "setpoint" or "operating range" of the largest subgroup of cortical interneurons, the 
parvalbumin positive fast-spiking (FS) neurons in mice. We vrill study the physiological, epigenetic, 
and transcriptional consequences of deleting enzymes that mediate methylation, selectively in these 
neurons . We vrill study the interaction between this regulation and regulation by actirity and other 
signaling pathways known to regulate these neurons including neuregulin 1 and its receptor ErbB4. 
In a second set of studies we investigate the role of micro RNA pathways in homeostatic plasticity of 
FS cell excitabUity, first by deleting the bios3nithetic enzyme dicer in FS neurons, and then by using 
novel profiling methods to identify actirity regulated microRNAs in these neurons. Finally, we ask 
which neuronal populations' actirity is the critical signal driring various forms of homeostatic 
regulation of inhibition. Using a combination of optogenetic activation and silencing strategies, we 
vrill determine which components of homeostatic plasticity are cell autonomous, and which depend 
on network actirity.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NELSON, SACHA B</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>P01GM105473</grantId><grantName>Fidelity of Repair within Repetitive DNA</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>8578724.39</amount><startDate>2014-05-10</startDate><endDate>2020-04-30</endDate><keyword>Affect, Attention, Chromatin, Disease, Disorder, DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid, DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases, DNA Polymerases, DNA Repair, Unscheduled DNA Synthesis, DNA Damage Repair, Single-Stranded DNA, Drosophila genus, fruit fly, Drosophila, Saccharomycetales, Endomycetales, Budding Yeast, Galactose, Galactopyranoside, Galactopyranose, D-Galactose, Gene Conversion, Goals, Health, Human, Modern Man, Light, Photoradiation, Mutation, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Proteins, Genetic Recombination, Recombination, DNA Recombination, Role, social role, Work, Mediating, HO nuclease, HO gene endonuclease, HO endonuclease, Site, repair, repaired, Gene Targeting, Collaborations, Chromosomal Breaks, Chromosome Break, programs, Frequencies, Complex, Event, homologous recombination, member, Appearance, genetic analysis, Genetic analyses, helicase, DNA unwinding enzyme, DNA Unwinding Proteins, DNA Helicases, Double Strand Break Repair, prevent, preventing, human disease,</keyword><description>This proposal focuses on several mutational changes accompanying DNA repair in budding yeast. DNA 
repair is induced by galactose-regulated expression of the site-specific HO endonuclease, creating a single 
double-strand break (DSB). One major goal is to understand complex mutations associated by template 
switching that occur during gene conversion. Two types of repair will be studied: 1. Quasipalindrome 
mutation formation during gene conversion and 2. Interchromosomal microhomology-mediated template 
switching during gene conversion. Genetic analysis of helicases and other repair factors will be screened to 
find proteins that control the level of these two events, along with an exploration of the role of chromatin. A 
second goal is to understand changes in repeat copy number during gene conversion, motivated by our 
recent discovery of important differences between DSB break repair and gap repair. In collaboration with 
Mitch McVey, another member of this Program Project who focuses on DSB repair in fruit flies, we will 
assess the frequency of abortive gap repair leading to deletions between repeated sequences within the

Using D. melanogaster as a model system, we propose to define a novel molecular pathway for thermal 
sensing involving a previously unappreciated class of potential thermal sensing protein. This work will thus 
lead to the definition of a new molecular pathway for thermal sensing of potentially broad relevance for both 
basic biology and human health. 
In preliminary experiments, we have identified a critical regulator of themnosensory behavior. Furthermore, 
we have found that this protein is capable of conferring thermal sensitivity upon a neuron when ectopically 
expressed. Together our preliminary data suggest this protein may function as a previously unappreciated 
type of thermal sensor. 
We propose to extend these studies in three aims. 
1) We will investigate the site of action and molecular nature ofthe putative thermal sensor in controlling 
thermotactic behavior. 
2) We will examine how this putative thermal sensor affects temperature sensing by thermosensory neurons. 
3) We will examine the molecular mechanisms by which the thermal sensor detects temperature by 
examining its potential signaling mechanism and the signaling pathways with which it may interact to 
transduce temperature infonnation. 
Together, these studies will provide fundamental new insights into the molecular mechanisms of thermal 
sensation. 
RELEVANCE (See instmctions): 
This proposal investigates the molecular mechanisms of thermal sensation. Thermosensation is critical for 
animal sun/ival and physiology. In humans, thermosensation is critical for pain, inflammation and tx)dy 
temperature regulation. Thus, thermosensory mechanisms are of biomedical relevance. In addition, 
themosensation is important for host-seeking by insect vectors of human diseases like malaria and West 
Nile. Thus the study of thermosensation is relevant to the control of insect-borne human disease.</description><investigator><investigatorId>GARRITY, PAUL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>N00173091G020</grantId><grantName>EEG BASED BMI CONTROL USING SELD IDENTIFFICATION.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A "homeostatic" mechanism functions to stabilize a key parameter of a system, much like a thermostat functions to stabilize the temperature in a building. In neurons, homeostatic synaptic plasticity is believed to counteract the destabilizing influence of Hebbian-plasticity mechanisms that underlie the activity-dependent refinement of synaptic connectivity. It is postulated that severe human pathologies arise from impaired mechanisms of neuronal homeostasis, including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Rett syndrome. A significant barrier to progress in this field is our nearly complete lack of insight ino homeostatic plasticity in the intact brain. I propose to study how homeostatic synaptic plasticity supports brain function and behavior in the freely behaving animal. Research in this proposal will focus on synaptic scaling, one of the best-understood mechanisms of neuronal activity homeostasis in vitro. First, work performed during the mentored (K99) component will define a functional role for synaptic scaling in firing rate homeostasis in vivo. To do this, I will utilizeviral-mediated gene transfer to block synaptic scaling in a subset of cortical neurons and test the homeostatic response to long-term sensory deprivation. Next, work performed during the mentored and independent phases will test the hypothesis that sleep is necessary for the expression of homeostatic plasticity in vivo. This will be achieved in two steps: (i) neuromodulatory state-specific and/or circadian patterns will be examined in the normal expression of homeostatic plasticity, and (ii) modulatory states will be disrupted at key times during the emergence of firing rate homeostasis in the freely behaving animal. Finally, during the independent stage (R00), I will assess the core prediction about homeostatic plasticity: those homeostatic mechanisms serve to offset the inherently destabilizing effects of Hebbian plasticity during experience dependent refinement of networks (i.e. learning and development). In this work, I will determine the role of synaptic scaling in a) the development of information transmission in cortical networks, and b) the development of cortex-dependent behavior. The proposed research will be instrumental for the understanding and treatment of disorders that are theorized to involve dysregulated homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Further, these data will provide novel insight into the effects of sleep deprivation. Finally, this work will identify parameters necessary for homeostatic plasticity in the healthy brain and provide insight into the role of homeostatic plasticity in higher-level brain functions. Candidate's immediate and long-term career goals my graduate training and postdoctoral experience thus far have provided me with a solid background in the methods and concepts related to the research proposed here. My long-term research goal is to understand the role of dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms in neurological disorders and disease, and to unravel the contributions of homeostatic plasticity to normal brain function.  In order to complete this work, I will need additional training in a variet of techniques as well as intellectual, professional, and academic guidance. The environment at Brandeis University combined with the dedication and expertise of my mentor, the members of my scientific and career subcommittee, and collaborators provides a perfect base from which to pursue an academic tenure-track position at a research university. The combined training in in vivo molecular biology, computational neuroscience, behavior, and technology development will provide the final elements necessary for me to begin an independent career investigating the role of homeostatic plasticity in normal brain function and disease. Key elements of the research career development plan. The research described in the mentored phase of this application will be performed at Brandeis University under the supervision of Dr. Gina Turrigiano. The Turrigiano laboratory pioneered the study of synaptic scaling and is a recognized leader in the field of homeostatic plasticity. I have assembled a scientific and career advisory subcommittee that is scientifically diverse and dedicated to my development as an independent scientist. Dr. Stephen Van Hooser will provide expertise in animal vision, computational techniques, and in vivo optogenetic manipulations. Dr. Avital Rodal will provide expertise in molecular biology techniques and oversee the interpretation of AMPAR trafficking manipulations. Dr. Eve Marder will provide expertise in computational neuroscience, experimental design, and theory. In addition to this training, I will spend two months in the laboratory of my collaborator, Dr. Timoth Gardner (Boston University) learning cutting-edge technology fabrication necessary for the advancement of in vivo neuroscience. Finally, I will support these activities with regular attendance of international meetings and research seminars to develop an international presence for myself and continue my education in relevant topics.

These recently discovered proteins are remarkable for three reasons: their biological role, in which a thermodynamically passive channel protects against high outside F-, their unprecedentedly high and biologically required 104-fold selectivity for F- over Cl-, and their unusual construction as dimers composed of antiparallel subunits that is reminiscent of inverted repeats in modern-day transporters. To address the biology of F- toxicity and resistance, I will monitor cytoplasmic F- accumulation in live wildtype and Fluc-knockout E. coli using 19F NMR as F- concentration and pH are varied to test the hypothesis that weak acid accumulation is the main mechanism for F- incursion across cell membranes. I will also explore the interplay between membrane potential, metabolism, and consequences for bacterial survival. To address the chemical problem of F- binding and selectivity, I will measure F- and Cl- transport in mutated channels to identify the molecular determinants of selectivity, the number of pores, and the role of residue redundancy in an unusual pore that possess symmetry parallel to the plane of the membrane. My choices of mutations will be guided by conserved residues, assignments of peaks that shift in NMR HSQC spectra during F- titrations, and mapping the location of channel blocker binding sites. Finally, I will address the unusual architecture of the Fluc dimer by first determining whether the channel is constructed with either unprecedented symmetry or transporter-like asymmetry by using single channel blocking experiments and by analyzing 15N HSQC spectra of the homodimer for "peak-doubling" characteristic of asymmetry. I will also work towards high-resolution structures of Fluc proteins using x-ray crystallography with crystallization chaperones and NMR. These experiments on a highly unusual channel that fills a highly unusual role will have biological and chemical ramifications, as well as implications on the
understanding of membrane protein function and evolution, and could pave the way for a novel class of drugs that target proteins widespread in microbes but absent in animals.</description><investigator><investigatorId>STOCKBRIDGE, RANDY B.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>K01MH101639</grantId><grantName>Molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent changes in neuronal connectivity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>287808.0</amount><startDate>2014-04-01</startDate><endDate>2017-09-30</endDate><keyword>adulthood, Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, psychological disorder, psychiatric illness, mental illness, Psychiatric Disorder, Psychiatric Disease, Mental health disorders, Mental disorders, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Factor IV, Coagulation Factor IV, Ca++ element, Blood Coagulation Factor IV, Calcium, Motility, Cellular Motility, Cellular Migration, Cell Movement, Cell Migration, Cell Locomotion, cell motility, Cell Body, Cells, Cognition, Dendrites, depression, Mental Depression, Environment, Eyeball, Eye, Future, Gene Expression, Gene Regulation Process, Gene Regulation, Gene Action Regulation, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, ontogeny, Tissue Growth, Generalized Growth, Growth, guanosinetriphosphatase, Guanosinetriphosphatases, GTPases, GTP Phosphohydrolases, Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases, Health, hippocampal, Hippocampus, Cornu Ammonis, Ammon Horn, Hippocampus (Brain), Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, In Vitro, Photoradiation, Light, Mentors, DNA Molecular Biology, Molecular Biology, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, Mus, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, Nervous system structure, Neural Transmission, Synaptic Transmission, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Rodent, social role, Role, schizophrenic, dementia praecox, Schizophrenic Disorders, Schizophrenia, backbone, Spine, Spinal Column, Vertebral column, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, Transcription, RNA Expression, Gene Transcription, Genetic Transcription, Translating, Up-Regulation, Upregulation, Virus, General Viruses, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, AMPA Receptors, Measures, Prosencephalon, Forebrain, Fore-Brain, Mediating, base, density, Site, Acute, Phase, Neurological, Neurologic, Immediate-Early Genes, Pyramidal Cells, Link, insight, Stimulus, Visual, Individual, Collaborations, Morphology, Shapes, Eye Dominance, Ocular Dominance, Ipsilateral, Sensory, Techniques, experience, model organism, Animal Models and Related Studies, Animal Model, Structure, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Reporting, Small GTPases, Small G-Proteins, Monomeric G-Proteins, Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, neural circuit, Property, response, voltage clamp, dendrite spine, Dendritic Spines, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNAi, RNA Silencing, Quelling, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, RNA Interference, Length, in vivo, mRNA Expression, Excitatory Synapse, Slice, Vector Mediated Transfer Genes, Transduction Gene, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, imaging, Image, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, 2-photon, two-photon, knockdown, knock-down, neuronal excitability, Synaptic plasticity, Coupled, small hairpin RNA, short hairpin RNA, shRNA, monocular deprivation, dark rearing, dark rear, postsynaptic, information processing, functional plasticity, neuropsychiatric disorder, neuropsychiatric disease,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During development and throughout adulthood, the nervous system transforms sensory experience from the environment into changes in neuronal activity which, in turn, cause long-lasting alterations in synaptic connections and dendritic arborization. Disruption to this process can result in long-term undesirable neurological consequences. For example, altered synapse number and functional plasticity responses are hallmarks of a number of mental health disorders including depression and schizophrenia [1-3]. Despite the importance of activity-dependent processes in shaping neuronal architecture, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which changes in neuronal excitability are translated into altered connectivity. Using an RNAi-based approach in cultured neurons, we identified the GTPase Rem2 as a novel regulator of excitatory synapse development [4, 5]. We have also demonstrated that Rem2 is a novel immediate early gene whose transcription is rapidly up-regulated in response to calcium influx via neuronal depolarization [6]. Thus, Rem2 may represent a key molecule through which external stimuli mediate direct effects on neuronal connectivity. To test this hypothesis in the intact nervous system of a vertebrate model organism, I propose to knockdown Rem2 in pyramidal neurons in rodent visual cortex and perform in vivo two-photon imaging of the synaptic contacts and overall circuit plasticity of these
neurons while modulating visual experience. This experience-dependent in vivo approach to identify the role of Rem2 in activity-dependent neural circuit development provides an excellent opportunity to increase our understanding of genetically encoded, activity- dependent neural circuitry. Through a unique collaboration between mentors with expertise in in vivo circuit analysis, synapse development, and the molecular biology of gene regulation, I will become an expert in an impressive array of experimental techniques which will allow me to probe the function of other activity- regulated genes in the intact nervous system in the future.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MOORE, ANNA R</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>HD5188114      5</grantId><grantName>FUNCTIONAL GEOMETRY AND THE TRAITE DE LUTHERIE</grantName><funderCode>418</funderCode><funderAgency>National Endowment for the Humanities</funderAgency><amount>60000.0</amount><startDate>2014-07-01</startDate><endDate>2015-06-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>H982301310247</grantId><grantName>HOMOLOGICAL AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN REPRESENTATION THEORY</grantName><funderCode>97</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Defense</funderAgency><amount>33926.0</amount><startDate>2013-05-13</startDate><endDate>2015-05-12</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>H-21600SG</grantId><grantName>CONTR GRANTS AGREE</grantName><funderCode>86</funderCode><funderAgency>Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research</funderAgency><amount>0.0</amount><startDate>2014-06-17</startDate><endDate>2012-11-30</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>FA95501210395</grantId><grantName>TAS::57 3600::TAS "HUMAN SPATIAL ORIENTATION IN DYNAMIC MOTION ENVIRONMENTS" DATED 30 JUN 2011</grantName><funderCode>97</funderCode><funderAgency>Department of Defense</funderAgency><amount>306407.0</amount><startDate>2012-07-15</startDate><endDate>2017-07-14</endDate><keyword /><description /><investigator><investigatorId /></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS105253</grantId><grantName>Rapid homeostatic plasticity of excitation-inhibition balance in thalamocortical microcircuits</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>122023.0</amount><startDate /><endDate>2019-12-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Animals, Axon, Brain, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Cell Body, Cells, Implanted Electrodes, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Epilepsy, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, facial, faces, Face, Feedback, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Homeostasis, In Vitro, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Interneurons, Methods, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Pathology, Physiology, Research, schizophrenic, dementia praecox, Schizophrenic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Sensory Deprivation, Striate area, Striate Cortex, Primary visual cortex, area striata, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Testing, thalamic, Thalamus, Thalamic structure, Time, visual cortical, Visual Cortex, Chronic, Ensure, Financial compensation, Compensation, Visual, Individual, Withdrawal, Measurement, Functional disorder, pathophysiology, Physiopathology, Dysfunction, Hour, Sensory, cell type, Pattern, experience, visual deprivation, sensory system, neural circuit, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, Regulation, Property, autism spectrum disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autistic Disorder, Autism, Data, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, Slice, Monitor, Process, Development, developmental, Pathway interactions, pathway, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, Pyramidal neuron, computer studies, computational studies, Disinhibition, neocortical, monocular, optogenetics, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, DREADDs, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, preservation, in vivo evaluation, in vivo testing, circadian,</keyword><description>The excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons in the brain are continually refined through
experience. To avoid hyper- or hypo excitability, homeostatic processes ensure that neuronal firing rates are
returned an appropriate set-point after perturbation. One important way to preserve appropriate neuronal
firing rates is through homeostatic regulation of the excitation-inhibition balance (E/I balance) within a circuit.
Only slow cell-autonomous homeostatic processes been identified in vivo, but studies suggest that more rapid
compensatory mechanisms are necessary to maintain stable firing in the face of rapid changes from Hebbian
plasticity. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that dynamic balancing of E/I is necessary for
networks to maintain stability, but this process has never been demonstrated in vivo.
 Thalamocortical (TC) axons send visual sensory information to the primary visual cortex, which mainly
terminate in neocortical layer 4 (L4). TC axons directly excite star pyramidal (SP) neurons and PV+ fast-spiking
(FS) interneurons. FS interneurons then provide disynaptic feedforward inhibition onto SP neurons.
Preliminary data from the Turrigiano lab indicates that the thalamocortical feedforward E/I ratio to SP
neurons is dynamically maintained. Interestingly, average firing rates (minutes to hours) of L4 SP neurons in
visual cortex are not different across environmental or circadian states. I hypothesize that SP neuron firing
rates are dynamically stabilized by scaling the strength of excitation to match the strength of feedforward
inhibition across vastly different levels of sensory drive. I will test this in vivo using two paradigms: i)
monocular visual deprivation (MD) and ii) modulation of PV+ FS firing rates using DREADDs. For each of
these paradigms, I will record firing rates of FS and SP neurons in L4 in vivo using chronic electrode implants,
and prepare cortical slices to probe for changes in synaptic properties at each synapse type.
 I expect that these experiments will elucidate basic principles about how neuronal firing rates are
regulated in vivo. If successful, this would extend our understanding of neuronal homeostasis beyond slow
cell-autonomous processes and reveal rapid, potentially network-level mechanisms that stabilize neuronal
firing rates on shorter timescales.</description><investigator><investigatorId>LANE, BRIAN JOSEPH</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS101832</grantId><grantName>The role of CaMKIV signaling in determining firing rate set points</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>115732.0</amount><startDate>2017-06-01</startDate><endDate>2019-05-31</endDate><keyword>transgene expression, neocortical, monocular deprivation, monocular, experimental research, experiment, experimental study, Calmodulin, Phosphodiesterase Protein Activator, Phosphodiesterase Activating Factor, Calcium-Dependent Regulator, Calcium-Dependent Activator Protein, Cells, Cell Body, Disease, Disorder, Epilepsy, epileptogenic, epileptiform, epilepsia, Seizure Disorder, Epileptics, Epileptic Seizures, Eye, Eyeball, Future, Health, Immunohistochemistry, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue, In Vitro, Interneurons, Internuncial Neuron, Internuncial Cell, Intercalated Neurons, Intercalary Neuron, Connector Neuron, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Light, Photoradiation, Maintenance, Mus, Murine, Mice Mammals, Mice, nervous system disorder, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Phosphotransferases, Transphosphorylases, Phosphotransferase Gene, Kinases, Play, Proteins, Rodent, Rodents Mammals, Rodentia, Role, social role, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Stains, Staining method, area striata, Striate area, Striate Cortex, Primary visual cortex, Synapses, synapse, Synaptic, Testing, Genetic Transcription, Transcription, RNA Expression, Gene Transcription, Visual Cortex, visual cortical, Work, Measures, Mediating, Chronic, Series, insight, awake, Individual, Genetic, Investigation, relating to nervous system, neural, novel, response, deprivation, unpublished works, prevent, preventing, autism spectrum disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, Data, Inhibitory Synapse, in vivo, Excitatory Synapse, Slice, Molecular, genetically engineered murine model, genetically engineered mouse model, GEM model, Genetically Engineered Mouse, Process, developmental, Development, imaging, Image, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, Pyramidal neuron, hippocampal pyramidal neuron, designing, design, neuronal excitability, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies,</keyword><description>Project Summary
Homeostatic plasticity bidirectionally constrains neuronal activity to a target firing range, allowing stable
neuronal and network function throughout development. In rodent visual cortex, monocular deprivation
causes the firing rate of neurons responding to the deprived eye to initially decrease before gradually
rebounding to within 15% of the baseline firing rate, even in the face of continued deprivation. This
homeostatic activity rebound occurs in neurons with baseline firing rates spanning three orders of magnitude,
demonstrating that each neuron has a firing rate set point maintained by cell-autonomous homeostatic
mechanisms. However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that control this firing rate set point
in vivo.
CaMKIV, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, plays a critical role in Ca2+-dependent gene transcription and
has been implicated in multiple forms of homeostatic plasticity. I have designed a series of experiments to test
the hypothesis that CaMKIV signaling coordinates different forms of homeostatic plasticity in vivo in response
to changes in activity, shifting firing rate towards a target rate influenced by CaMKIV protein levels. First, I will
measure the relationship between neuronal activity and CaMKIV protein levels in cortical slices and test the
effect of prolonged activity deprivation in vivo on CaMKIV protein levels. Then, by manipulating CaMKIV
protein levels in vivo, I will test the role of CaMKIV signaling in coordinating different types of homeostatic
plasticity ex vivo and establishing the firing rate set point in vivo.
These experiments will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into how neurons and networks maintain
stable function despite varying inputs. The ability to adjust firing rate set points in vivo could lead to
conceptually novel treatment approaches for neurological disorders characterized by dysregulated neuronal
activity, such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy.</description><investigator><investigatorId>TROJANOWSKI, NICHOLAS </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS098624</grantId><grantName>Synapses Between Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) and Dopamine Neurons Modulate Sleep and Learning in Drosophila</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>112888.04</amount><startDate>2016-08-01</startDate><endDate>2017-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Aging, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer's Disease, Behavior, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, associative conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning, Associative Learning, classical conditioning, Cues, Disorder, Disease, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Drosophila melanogaster, balance function, balance, Equilibrium, γ-Aminobutyric Acid, GABA, Aminalone, Aminalon, 4-amino-butanoic acid, 4-Aminobutyric Acid, 4-Aminobutanoic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Modern Man, Human, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Learning, Learning Disorders, Mammals, Mammalia, Memory, Nervous system structure, Neurologic Organ System, Neurologic Body System, Nervous System, nervous system disorder, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurotransmitters, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Neurosciences, Odors, Pharmacology, Role, social role, Serotonin, Hippophaine, Enteramine, 5HT, 5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT, Signal Transduction, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Sleep, Sleep disturbances, Suggestion, Synapses, synapse, Synaptic, Synaptic Receptors, Testing, Time, Work, Measures, improved, Dorsal, Medial, Link, insight, Stimulus, Conditioned Stimulus, Potentiation, Chemosensitization/Potentiation, Chemosensitization, Therapeutic, Reporter, long term memory, Complex, System, Neurodegenerative Disorders, neurodegenerative illness, degenerative neurological diseases, degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neuro-degenerative Disorders, Neural degenerative Disorders, Neural Degenerative Diseases, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, experience, neurogenetics, Performance, receptor, Receptor Protein, memory acquisition, forgetting, neuroregulation, neuromodulatory, neuromodulation, neural regulation, neural control, sleep regulation, sleep control, Animal Model, model organism, model of animal, Animal Models and Related Studies, neuronal circuitry, neuronal circuit, behavior test, behavioral test, neural circuit, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, dopaminergic neuron, Dopamine neuron, DA Neuron, Sleep Disorders, sleep problem, Modeling, response, Neuromodulator, Mushroom Bodies, RNA Interference, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNAi, RNA Silencing, Quelling, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, prevent, preventing, Address, Data, Transmission, transmission process, Process, Behavioral, Flies, fly, imaging, Image, pathway, Pathway interactions, Output, knockdown, knock-down, designing, design, novel strategy, novel approaches, new approaches, novel strategies, Mind, Impairment, Positive Valence, Negative Valence, memory consolidation, reduce symptoms, symptom relief, symptom reduction, symptom alleviation, relieves symptoms, fewer symptoms, decrease symptom, ameliorating symptom, alleviate symptom, translational impact,</keyword><description> / ABSTRACT
Disorders of sleep and associative learning co-occur in many diseases, including primary sleep disorders,
plasticity disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders. These widespread connections between learning and
sleep in human neurological disease indicate that there are neuronal circuits shared by sleep and learning in
humans. Because these circuits are shared, therapeutic approaches designed for one system may also benefit
the other, for example, treatments for sleep disturbance may also ameliorate symptoms of neurodegenerative
disorders. Therefore, understanding the neural circuits connecting sleep and learning has the potential for
significant scientific and translational impact. However, sleep and learning are both complex behaviors, and
tracing a neuron-scale circuit for either is not currently possible in mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster has a simpler nervous system than a mammal (about 100,000 neurons), while still displaying
robust learning and sleep behaviors. Furthermore, the circuits for associative memory and sleep have been
well studied in fruit flies. We propose to study the connections between a pair of neurons known to be
necessary for both memory and sleep, the Dorsal Paired Medial neurons (DPMs), and other memory and sleep
associated neurons in the fruit fly brain. We hypothesize that DPMs increase in activity after learning, which
has two main effects. First, increased DPM activity causes the flies to sleep more. Second, DPMs inhibit
dopamine neurons that cause forgetting of recent experiences, thereby improving the formation of new
memories. We will test this hypothesis by: 1. Measuring connections between DPMs, dopamine neurons, and
an important fly memory system, the Mushroom Body, 2. Blocking the DPMs, and measuring if learning still
has an effect on sleep, and 3. Blocking the effect of DPMs on dopamine neurons, and measuring if formation
of new memories is affected. Testing this hypotheses will provide important new information. First, we will
better understand how an experience is turned into a long term memory in a simple brain, giving us deeper
insight into how out own minds work. Second, we will know if the effects that a memory-promoting neuron has
on sleep and memory are independent or related to one another. Third, we will gain greater insight into how
dopamine neurons that signal value can simultaneously promote learning new memories and forgetting old
memories.</description><investigator><investigatorId>WIGGIN, TIMOTHY DAVID</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32NS078872</grantId><grantName>Understanding the Effect of N-Terminal Acetylation on alpha-Synuclein Toxicity</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>99427.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-16</startDate><endDate>2014-09-02</endDate><keyword>Acetylation, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer's Disease, Amyloid Substance, Amyloid, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Biology, Cells, Circular Dichroism, Clinical Markers, Color, 1-Naphthalenesulfonic acid, 3,3'-((1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diylbis(azo))bis(4-amino)-, disodium salt, Congo Red, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, Drug Design, E coli, Escherichia coli, Genes, Health, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, In Vitro, Kinetics, Microscopy, Electron Microscopy, Movement Disorder Syndromes, Dyskinesia Syndromes, Movement Disorders, genome mutation, Genetic defect, Genetic Change, Genetic Alteration, Mutation, neuronal degeneration, neurodegenerative, neurodegeneration, neural degeneration, Neuron Degeneration, Nerve Degeneration, Primary Parkinsonism, Parkinsons disease, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's, Parkinson, Paralysis Agitans, Lewy Body Parkinson Disease, Idiopathic Parkinson Disease, Parkinson Disease, Play, Protein Modification, Posttranslational Protein Processing, Posttranslational Modifications, Post-Translational Protein Modification, Post-Translational Modifications, Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry, Post-Translational Protein Processing, gene product, Proteins, social role, Role, S. cerevisiae, S.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative movement disorder, whose clinical markers include the formation of alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) rich aggregates in the substantia nigra . Despite the identification of alpha-Syn, a 14 kDa protein, as a target of interest in the treatment of PD, much remains unknown about this protein. Factors behind its aggregation and toxicity are unclear, however studies have indicated that posttranslational modifications play an important role. N-terminal acetylation has been seen as a potential factor in the disease state, yet this modification remains largely unstudied. This project is designed to clarify the role of N- terminal acetylation and the effects of this modification on alpha-Syn. The stability and toxicity of the modified and unmodified proteins will be determined through in vivo assays in yeast studying the aggregation and subcellular localization of alpha-Syn. Structural studies utilizing circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy will examine any structural changes resulting from the posttranslational modifications. The effect of these posttranslational modifications on the PD-associated mutants, A30P, E46K, and A53T, will also be studied.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to properly transmit and store information, neural networks must be able to compensate for short and long-term changes in internal environment (e.g. sleep/wake cycles, development, aging, and disease) as well rapid changes in external, stimulus-driven inputs. Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that stabilize neuronal activity in the face of such perturbations have been described in vitro (1), but little is known about their role in stabilizing circuit function in the freely behaving animal. Dysregulation of homeostatic plasticity is widely hypothesized to contribute to debilitating pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (2), Rett syndrome (3), and epilepsy (4), thus an understanding of its role in vivo is critical. It is currently unknown whether neurons and neural networks exhibit homeostatic regulation of spike activity (firing rate homeostasis) and/or complex network properties in the awake and freely behaving animal, a prediction I aim to test in this study by following the activit of individual neocortical neurons over time in the freely behaving rat. First, neuronal activity an the response to activity deprivation will be assessed in the visual cortex of freely behaving and freely viewing juvenile rats. Through the use of genetic manipulations and activity deprivation, the mechanistic role of a well- studied form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, synaptic scaling, in firing rate homeostasis in vivo will be investigated. Finally, I will exploit a unique feature o this experimental technique to examine the interaction between plasticity mechanisms and behavioral state. Chronic recordings in normally behaving animals enable me to ask whether the expression of homeostatic plasticity is governed by behavior, arousal state, network state (via local field potentials), and circadian factors (5). Characterization of firing rate homeostasi in the normally behaving animal is essential for understanding how neural networks operate. Investigating the contributions of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms such as synaptic scaling to normal brain function is critical for understanding their physiological role. Further, an examination of the role of activity and arousal-state in the expression of homeostatic plasticity will clarify the role of sleep in brain function and plasticity. This knowledge will advance our understanding of basic cellular, systems, and computational neuroscience, as well as provide insight for future investigations of diseases that disrupt neuronal homeostasis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of cold detection, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Sensory systems play key roles in human health. Not only is human sensory system dysfunction associated with disease, the detection of temperature is important for the survival and host-seeking behavior of insect vectors of human disease. At present, our molecular understanding of temperature detection in insects is limited: insect cold receptors have not been reported. Our preliminary data suggest two Ionotropic Receptor family members, IR21a and IR25a, are involved in cold sensing. Ionotropic receptors (IRs) are a subfamily of iGluRs in invertebrates (Drosophila has 66 IRs) known to act not as mediators of glutamate- dependent synaptic transmission, but as chemoreceptors for acids and amines. We are proposing to test the hypothesis that specific isoforms of IR21a and IR25a drive cold avoidance by acting in the cold sensors of the arista and/or labellum. Using cell-specific rescue experiments, we propose to determine which IR21a and IR25a isoforms mediate cold avoidance, and to test whether expression of these IRs in cold sensors is necessary and/or required for cold avoidance. We will also test if IR21a and IR25a mediate cold sensing. Using a combination of calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we will examine the contribution of IR21a and IR25a to cold sensing by examining how the cold-responsiveness of each set of cold sensors is altered in mutants lacking these proteins. I will also test whether IR21a and IR25a act forming a cold receptor by ectopic expression of these proteins in the fly and by heterologous expression in frog oocytes and in cultured mammalian cells. These studies will contribute for the understanding of cold-reception and the identification
of the receptors will be extremely significant to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep is a highly conserved, essential behavior that impacts mental and physical health, but the mechanisms that control sleep are poorly understood. Sleep and sleep homeostasis (increases in sleep after sleep loss) occurs in nearly all animals. In humans, sleep loss impairs learning and memory and is linked to obesity and heart disease. Changes in sleep/wake status are accompanied by changes in the expression of many genes, but what controls these changes is not known. One mechanism that may be important is the regulation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by microRNAs (miRs). MiRs are small (22 nucleotide), non-coding RNAs that bind to the 3' un-translated regions of mRNAs and alter their translation and stability. miRs bind to many different mRNA targets, and therefore can regulate the translation of multiple genes at the same time. The abundance of some miRs varies with time of day and amount of sleep, making miRs promising candidate regulators of gene expression during sleep. While a few miRs have been found to affect sleep/wake cycles in Drosophila and mammals, the role of miRs in sleep has not been systematically tested and no miRs required for sleep homeostasis have been identified.  The goal of this research is to identify and characterize miRs that regulate sleep and the sleep homeostat. Drosophila will be used to study sleep, because they are a well validated model for mammalian sleep and have powerful genetic tools, including methods for spatial and temporal control of gene expression. In this project, these genetic tools will be used to manipulate expression of genetically encoded inhibitors of miR function called miR sponges. Preliminary studies using this approach have already identified multiple promising miRs, including miR-190. miR-190 expression increases after sleep, and inhibition of miR-190 function impairs sleep and sleep recovery after sleep deprivation. This project aims to (1) identify novel miRs that regulate sleep behavior and sleep homeostasis; (2) determine where and when those miRs are required by expressing miR sponges in different cell types (including neurons and glia) and at different points in the fly lif cycle; (3) to characterize the role of miR-190 in sleep and by identifying its mRNA targets, which are likely to be essential genes for sleep and sleep homeostasis.

Genome stability requires fidelity in the processes involved in genome replication, repair, and segregation, and this is achieved by coordinated action of repair pathways and cell cycle controls including the cell cycle checkpoints. The DNA Damage Checkpoint (DDC) triggers G2/M arrest when DNA is damaged after replication, and the maintenance of this arrest requires the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). In animals, SAC proteins have been found at some kinetochores upon DNA damage, however how SAC is controlled in DNA damage response is unknown. This research aims to uncover the mechanism of crosstalk between two highly- conserved cell cycle checkpoints, the SAC and the DDC, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The goal of Aim 1 is to identify how the SAC responds to signals from DNA double- stranded breaks (DSBs) by: (1) determining whether an unrepairable DSB recruits SAC proteins to kinetochores through disruption of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, (2) identifying factors that affect SAC activity following DSB formation. Effects of DSB on kinetochore-microtubule attachment and SAC complex recruitment to kinetochores on the broken chromosome will be examined using live cell (4-D) microscopy. In parallel, the pattern of SAC activity relative to DDC activity following DSB formation will be analyzed using molecular markers for SAC activity (Mad1 phosphorylation) and for DDC activity (Rad53 and Chk1 phosphorylation). Knowledge about when SAC becomes important during DSB-induced G2/M arrest and factors affecting this timing will constrain the possible mechanisms of SAC regulation after DSB formation. Aim 2 is designed to identify proteins that act through the SAC in the DNA damage response. The first approach will be a targeted genetic analysis of DDC and SAC genes that will reveal whether DDC proteins control SAC proteins during DSB- induced G2/M arrest. In contrast, the second, unbiased, approach aims to identify novel factors involved in SAC regulation upon DNA damage. Mutations in genes required to maintain DSB-induced G2/M arrest will be selected by generating a DSB in a supernumerary chromosome so that DSB- induced chromosome loss will not cause lethality during screening. By applying strategies used in Aim 1 to characterize SAC regulators identified in Aim 2, the proposed research will uncover the mechanism of SAC control during the DNA damage response. Since DDC and SAC misregulation occurs in many cancers, understanding their regulatory interactions will not only advance our understanding of how eukaryotic cells prevent proliferation when challenged by DNA damage, but will also highlight potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.</description><investigator><investigatorId>NAKAJIMA, YUKO </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F32DC013711</grantId><grantName>Genetic and neural basis of pheromone sensory integration in nematodes</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>103408.0</amount><startDate>2014-01-01</startDate><endDate>2015-12-31</endDate><keyword>adulthood, adult human (21+), Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Affect, Animals, Behavior, Chemoreceptors, Communication, Cues, Diagnosis, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, Environment, Family, Health, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Larva, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, male, Methods, roundworm, Nematodes, Nematoda, Nematode infections, Neural Pathways, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, living system, Organism, Pheromone, Research Resources, Resources, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Work, Molecular Genetics, C.elegans, C elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans, avoidance behavior, base, improved, Site, Variation, Variant, Chemicals, insight, Stimulus, Individual, Genetic, Staging, Life, Complex, Sensory, Parasitic nematode, experience, adult animal, mature animal, Receptor Protein, receptor, sensory mechanism, sex dimorphism, sexual dimorphism, neuromodulation, neural regulation, neural control, neuroregulation, model organism, Animal Models and Related Studies, Animal Model, neural, relating to nervous system, sensory integration, novel, member, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, G Protein-Complex Receptor, G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, Parasitic infection, Modeling, response, Kairomones, small molecule, T11, SRBC, CD2 gene, Address, Defect, Data, Detection, Signaling Molecule, Molecular, Process, sex, developmental, Development, Behavioral, Population, neural mechanism, neuromechanism, combinatorial, combat, public health relevance, flexible, flexibility,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory defects are a major human health concern. While defects can often occur at the level of sensory detection, these processes can also fail at the level of sensory integration. Therefore, it is essential to understand sensory signaling at bot the level of detection and integration. Chemical signals, such as small molecule pheromones and kairomones, are used by humans and most other animals to communicate with and respond to their environment. These chemicals can elicit very different responses depending on the external (environmental influences) or internal state of the recipient. Although this response flexibility is critical for animal survival, the neural mechanisms that contribute to this adaptabiity are not well understood. To understand this process, one must identify the site(s) of signal integration of multiple stimuli and subsequently determine how these signals converge to promote novel responses. Due to its experimental amenability, these mechanisms can be identified in the nematode, C. elegans, which uses conserved chemical signal transduction complexes in sensory neurons. Identification of the mechanisms of signal integration in C. elegans will not only improve methods for the diagnosis and treatment of chemosensory disorders, but will also lead to new strategies to control parasitic nematodes through interference with pheromone signaling. To identify mechanisms of sensory signal integration, this proposal focuses on two conserved ascaroside (ascr) pheromones, ascr#3 and ascr#9, which produce sexually-dimorphic (intrinsic) and context-specific (environmental) behavioral responses. Aim 1: Determine the genetic, molecular and neural basis of ascr#3-dependent sexually-dimorphic signaling in adult animals. Sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to ascr#3 require sensory input from the ADL chemosensory neurons via largely undefined molecular mechanisms. Preliminary data indicate that these sexually dimorphic behaviors may be due to differences in neuronal sex, and that a member of the SRBC family of G-protein coupled receptors may encode ascr#3-specific receptors in ADL. This proposal will identify and characterize the first adult-specific chemoreceptor(s) and signaling molecules that regulate ascr#3-dependent C. elegans adult behaviors and determine the basis of sexually dimorphic responses to ascr#3. Aim 2: Identify the role of ascr#9 in dauer larval avoidance behavior in combination with other pheromone cues. Under limited resources, many nematodes enter an alternative developmental stage, termed the dauer larva, that facilitates dispersal (in free living
nematodes) and infection (in parasitic nematodes). The conserved pheromone ascr#9 directs avoidance behavior in dauer larvae of several species when presented in combination with other ascr cues, providing an excellent model for combinatorial sensory input. This proposal will specifically determine the neural basis of combinatorial effects of ascr#9 on larval avoidance and identify molecular mechanisms of ascr#9-dependent signaling through the analysis of natural variation in wild C. elegans strains.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain is subject to the action of numerous amino acids, amines, and neuropeptides. These local neurotransmitters and diffuse neuromodulators functionally reconfigure neuronal circuitry and allow for flexible, yet stable, behavioral output (Marder, 2012). Dysfunction of modulatory and transmitter systems has been implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders. In order to understand how the healthy brain mediates this dynamic chemical milieu, we must first understand how single neurons mediate the action of many signaling molecules. The proposed work addresses this question in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), a small motor circuit containing 26-30 large, identifiable neurons with complex morphologies. All STG neurons are responsive to both GABA (Swensen et al., 2000) and glutamate (Marder &amp; Paupardin- Tritsch, 1978; Cleland &amp; Selverston, 1998). The subcellular distribution of GABA and glutamate ionotropic receptors, and the electrical properties of the compartments in which they function, likely dictates the weights with which these ligands influence the firing properties of single STG neurons. It is plausible tha these neurons differentially co-regulate and exhibit stereotyped spatial distributions of ionotropi receptors, and that these receptor distributions contribute to their unique firing properties. This
hypothesis will be addressed using a custom optical system for focal photo-activation and mapping of ionotropic GABA and glutamate responses across the structures of different STG neuron types. These maps will be complemented with mRNA expression studies to determine if sensitivities to these two ligands are co-regulated in a compartment-specific or neuron- wide manner. Lastly, these maps will be used as a framework for understanding the functional relevance of subcellular receptor distributions in the face of a modulatory perturbation. Previous work has shown that dopamine alters glutamate receptor sensitivity in STG neurons (Cleland &amp; Selverston, 1997; Johnson &amp; Harris- Warrick, 1997). Focal photo-activation of glutamate receptors in tandem with spatially and temporally controlled iontophoretic dopamine administration will be used to probe whether this modulatory change in glutamate sensitivity occurs by uniformly or heterogeneously modulating different subcellular glutamate receptor loci across the structure of single neurons.

involves global changes in excitatory synaptic weights onto a neuron. However, there is recent in vitro evidence for the existence of local or synapse-specific forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that are mechanistically distinct from synaptic scaling. The occurrence of these local forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity has not been explored in vivo. We have recently developed a system we can use to probe changes in quantal amplitude at targeted synaptic subsets, and we are using this system to determine whether convergent synaptic subsets are affected differentially by experience-dependent homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Our system entails an optogenetic means of evoking desynchronized vesicle release selectively from LGN thalamocortical (TC) synapses or lamina-specific intracortical (IC) synapses of L4 neurons in acutely prepared brain slices of V1. Preliminary data reveals that following 4 days of monocular deprivation there is a significant potentiation in evoked TC event amplitude, consistent with the induction of homeostatic synaptic plasticity at TC inputs. To determine whether this observed potentiation is occurring as a global L4 or local TC homeostatic synaptic modification, we will compare changes in quantal properties at TC synapses with those evoked from L4 IC synapses obtained during equivalent periods of deprivation. Furthermore, we will locally disrupt GluR2 or GluR1 C-tail dependent AMPAR trafficking to determine whether the mechanisms of synaptic potentiation at TC and IC synapses are distinct. We also plan to determine whether the trends we observe are limited to L4 star pyramidal neurons or whether they are also expressed in local FS interneuron populations. Finally, we propose to develop a system utilizing Ca2+ imaging in cortical slices for assessing network-level changes associated with observed experience-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms. These combined experiments will provide novel information regarding in vivo homeostasis of TC, IC and inhibitory circuitry in response to experience perturbation.</description><investigator><investigatorId>MISKA, NATHANIEL </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31NS086764</grantId><grantName>Investigating the cellular basis of memory consolidation in Drosophila</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>50597.0</amount><startDate>2013-09-16</startDate><endDate>2015-06-16</endDate><keyword>cAMP, adenosine 3'5' monophosphate, Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate), Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate, Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate, 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP, Cyclic AMP, Animals, Behavior, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Factor IV, Coagulation Factor IV, Ca++ element, Blood Coagulation Factor IV, Calcium, Cells, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology, Electrophysiology (science), Goals, hippocampal, Hippocampus, Cornu Ammonis, Ammon Horn, Hippocampus (Brain), Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Learning, Mammalia, Mammals, Memory, Cognitive Retention Disorders, Memory Disorders, Neuroanatomies, Neuranatomy, Neuranatomies, Neuroanatomy, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Nerve Transmitter Substances, Neurotransmitters, Pharmacology, Public Health, public health medicine (field), Publishing, Researchers, Investigators, Research Personnel, social role, Role, Work, Imaging Technics, Imaging Procedures, Imaging Techniques, Measures, base, Dorsal, Medial, Training, Memory Deficit, Memory impairment, insight, Genetic, tool, Nature, Life, long term memory, Complex, Sensory, cell type, Techniques, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, experience, mutant, Structure, novel, Modeling, response, Mushroom Bodies, Address, in vivo, Molecular, Process, Behavioral, Output, conditioning, Trauma, innovative, innovate, innovation, fluorescence imaging, public health relevance,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ability to address memory disorders in humans is impeded by the complexity of mammalian memory circuits and our limited understanding of the basic processes underlying memory storage. Many behaviors and molecular processes of the relatively simple Drosophila memory circuit are conserved in mammals, providing a powerful model for investigating memory consolidation. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation in this animal will therefore be useful for gaining insights that can be applied to te more complex neuroanatomy and conserved cell types of mammalian memory circuits. The mushroom bodies (MBs) in the Drosophila brain are important structures for learning and memory that integrate sensory experiences to regulate behavior much like the mammalian hippocampus. Behavioral studies have suggested that the MBs are modulated by a set of cells known as the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, and these neurons have been shown to be necessary for memory consolidation. The explicit functional connectivity between these two groups of cells is still unknown, however, and the cellular mechanisms underlying the DPM neurons' involvement in memory consolidation have not been characterized. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the functional connection between the DPM neurons and the MBs in order to expand our understanding of the cellular interactions responsible for memory consolidation in Drosophila. The primary obstacle to studying this behavioral circuit is that the DPM neurons are fragile and deeply situated in the brain, and are therefore difficult to access using electrophysiology. This proposal utilizes recent innovations in Drosophila genetics to observe the interactions between the DPM neurons and MBs using live fluorescence imaging. Observing the behavior of this memory circuit using pharmacology ex vivo and after a learning paradigm in vivo will contribute to our understanding of the circuit- and cellular-level strategies
that animals use to modulate memory consolidation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurological diseases affect all age groups and segments of society in every country around the world. Many of these diseases are, at the most basic level, caused by the inability of circuits, synapses, and neurons to normally adjust to changes in their cellular environment resulting in an imbalance in neuronal activity. To treat these disorders, basic research is needed to understand how healthy neurons are able to sense, to compensate for, and to maintain a proper activity level. This proposal will add to the body of knowledge about how a healthy nervous system is able to remain plastic throughout a human lifetime while also maintaining functional connections in the face of change. Using Drosophila, where many of the basic neural molecules and proteins are conserved, provides a relatively simple, well-characterized system that has many powerful genetic tools to manipulate specific sub-groups of neurons. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, motor neurons in larval Drosophila can be directly recorded from to measure the neuron's firing properties and intrinsic properties. This work will investigate how motor neurons sense changes in their activity and set in motion a series of molecular steps beginning with calcium that results in changes to channels and conductances that affect cell excitability. Using a new technique, neurons will be activated by light during sensitive periods of development and the effect of this activity on the neurons wil be measured. In addition, the genetic tools available in Drosophila will be used to manipulate parts of the calcium pathway believed to be essential for a neuron to sense its own activity. This work will be the first in Drosophila to investigate how increased neuronal activity during specific
periods of development can affect the excitability of individual neurons. It also directly addresses how individual neurons are able to sense and respond to changes in their local environment to maintain a preferred level of excitability over time by investigating a pathway that
has been shown to be important in cellular excitability in a number of organisms including mammals. This work will lead to a better understanding of how many neurological diseases may develop and change over time, such as epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural networks are complex arrangements of neurons with a variety of dynamic intrinsic properties, and exist in dynamic physiological environments. Achieving stable function requires that these networks regulate their properties to preserve important output features despite these underlying instabilities. These processes are poorly understood, and will be examined here by exploitation of a well characterized pattern-generating neural network, the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The STG contains the motor neurons of two networks that drive rhythmic motor patterns involved in the processing of food: the pyloric (filtering) network, which is constitutively active both in vivo and in disseced in vitro preparations of the stomatogastric nervous system; and the gastric (chewing) network, which is episodic, being activated by modulatory inputs only after feeding. Previous in vitro work has shown that upon removal of these inputs by transection of the only input nerve (decentralization), both types of rhythmic activity cease, but after a period of several days in culture, rhythmic pyloric activity returns. Gastric activity has not been previously described in decentralized preparations, but preliminary data indicates that gastric recovery may also occur in this paradigm. This work will characterize changes occurring in the gastric network following days of decentralization, when maintained in organotypic culture, and test the hypothesis that the gastric network can also regain its rhythmic character, despite the loss of modulatory input. Unlike the pyloric network, the gastric circuit has been shown to directly involve the nerve terminals of descending modulatory inputs; thus any recovery must occur by a reorganization of the essential circuit, a fundamentally different process than that which has been described in the pyloric network. This hypothesis will be tested by three main avenues. First, the phenomenology of recovery will be characterized by continuously recording gastric activity extracellularly along output motor nerves. Second, intracellular changes occurring during the course of recovery in gastric cells will be determined by measuring a variety of intrinsic properties. Third, the abilityof severed neuromodulatory inputs to participate in recovered circuitry will be tested by stimulation and immunocytochemical staining. Taken together, these experiments will provide a window into the complex regulatory processes involved in the maintenance of stable network function. Specifically, this system potentially offers an excellent model for the changes that occur in vertebrate spinal cord injury, where the motor patterns involved in locomotion are also episodic, and frequently develop pathologic activity following loss of modulatory input.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proper functioning of neuronal circuits critically depends on the establishment of balanced of excitation and inhibition during development. We hypothesize that failure of this maturational process can lead to epileptic disorders such as Infantile Spasms syndrome (IS or West syndrome), a group of devastating childhood epileptic encephalopathies. Specifically, we hypothesize that activity deprivation during a key developmental window triggers abnormal recruitment of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, which results in an acquired imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. We propose that alterations in the structural maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses are likely to contribute to the circuit changes that underlie IS epileptic encephalopathies. Therefore, in this proposal we aim to use a combination of electrophysiological and structural methods to study the development of connectivity between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in an in vitro model of IS. We expect this will provide insights into how excitatory and inhibitory neurons act to
homeostatically regulate network activity during normal development and also how their dysfunction might contribute to network excitability disorders.

Proper neuronal communication depends on the precise assembly and development of synaptic connections between neurons. Many neurological disorders arise from perturbations in synaptic connectivity, such as mental retardation, autism, and Rett Syndrome (Fernandez and Garner, 2007; Rubenstein and Marzenich, 2003; Tabuchi et al., 2007; Zoghbi, 2003). In addition, many synaptic proteins, including Semaphorin family members, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (Weiss et al, 2009) and the lack of Semaphorins results in improper synaptic connectivity in rodents (Morita et al., 2006; O'Connor et al., 2009; Paradis et al., 2007; Sahay et al., 2005). The 
transmembrane protein Sema4D is necessary for proper GABAergic synapse formation, as knockdown of expression in the postsynaptic neuron by RNAi leads to a decrease in GABAergic synaptic density in cultured neurons (Paradis et al 2007). Our preliminary results demonstrate that addition of the soluble, extracellular domain of Sema4D to cultured hippocampal neurons is sufficient to drive GABAergic synapse formation. Importantly, this increase is dependent on the expression of Sema4D's receptor, PlexinB1. In addition, our voltage-clamp experiments indicate that PlexinB1 is necessary for proper GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, our work defines PlexinB1 as a novel receptor mediating GABAergic synapse formation in response to Sema4D in the mammalian CNS. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of Sema4D and it's receptor, PlexinB1 in GABAergic synapse development. In experiments proposed here, we hypothesize that Sema4D acts to initiate assembly of GABAergic synaptic proteins such as GABAA receptors and gephyrin through its receptor PlexinB1. This will be tested using a variety of imaging techniques in cultured hippocampal neurons, including confocal and time- lapse imaging, to measure the mobility and accumulation of GABAergic synaptic proteins in neurons after treatment with soluble Sema4D. In addition, preliminary data suggests that PlexinB1 is important for GABAergic synaptic transmission. Electrophysiology will be used to determine the site of action of PlexinB1 function to regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission. The experiments proposed here will not only greatly expand our understanding of a novel receptor-ligand pair in GABAergic synapse development; it will inform us as to some of the basic mechanisms underlying GABAergic synaptogenesis. !</description><investigator><investigatorId>KUZIRIAN, MARISSA STEARNS</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31NS071897</grantId><grantName>Painless and TRPA1: TRP teamwork supports chemical nociception in Drosophila</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>48090.0</amount><startDate>2011-01-01</startDate><endDate>2013-05-15</endDate><keyword>Animals, Bronchial Asthma, Asthma, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Encephalon, Brain Nervous System, Brain, Factor IV, Coagulation Factor IV, Ca++ element, Blood Coagulation Factor IV, Calcium, Cells, Complement Proteins, Complement, disease/disorder, Disorder, Disease, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Elements, Eyeball, Eye, Goals, Health, Heating, Histology, Modern Man, Man (Taxonomy), Human, Antisera, Immune Sera, Insects Invertebrates, Insects, Insecta, Invertebrata, Invertebrates, Membrane Channels, Ionic Channels, Ion Channel, Irritants, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Nociceptors, Onions, Painful, Pain, Plants, Publishing, Research, social role, Role, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, Taste, Gustation, Taste Perception, vertebrata, Vertebrate Animals, Vertebrates, Work, Measures, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, sensor, Site, Chronic, Physiologic, Physiological, Chemicals, insight, nociceptive, Nociception, not painful, non-painful, Painless, smoke of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, Genetic, Inflammatory, Nature, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, experience, mutant, Receptor Protein, receptor, response, disease control, disorder control, Cinnamon, Cinnamon - dietary, Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, RNAi, RNA Silencing, Quelling, Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing, Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing, RNA Interference, ward, Detection, Dominant-Negative Mutant, Dominant Negative, Antimorphic mutation, Dominant-Negative Mutation, Resolution, Molecular, Process, Behavioral, Flies, fly, imaging, Image, designing, design, environmental chemical, stimulus processing, public health relevance,</keyword><description>  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Anyone who has become teary-eyed cutting an onion, caught a whiff of wasabi, or tasted the spiciness of cinnamon, has experienced, first-hand, the painful potential of chemicals. Numerous plants and animals rely on damaging chemicals to ward off predators, and environmental, chemical irritants have been implicated in human inflammatory disorders, such as asthma. Studying how animals detect and avoid noxious chemicals - a process known as chemical nociception - may be useful for the design of effective pest repellents and for understanding how painful stimuli are processed in humans. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels cooperate during many aspects of nociception; however, the nature of this cooperation is poorly characterized. In Drosophila, two TRP channels - Painless and dTRPA1 - are required for flies to avoid reactive electrophiles, pungent chemicals active in wasabi, cinnamon, and cigarette smoke. dTRPA1 functions as a molecular sensor for these compounds, but Painless is unlikely to be a direct chemical sensor, making its role during this form of nociception unclear. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the function of Painless during dTRPA1- mediated chemical nociception. This work will contribute to our understanding of how TRP channels cooperate during nociception and will provide insights into the mechanisms of pain signaling at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hippocampus is thought to be essential to many forms of memory. Elucidating the neural code underlying processing during behavior and later recall may lead to an understanding of specific points of failure in diseases in which the functioning of the hippocampus is compromised, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's. An understanding of the neural code is necessary to understand communication between brain areas, which could lead to an ability to directly interface with the hippocampus. The goal of this project is to explore one hypothesis of how the hippocampus takes advantage of the spatial properties of the firing of place cells in forms of memory that are sequential in nature.  Place cells in the hippocampus preferentially fire when an animal is in a particular location in a given environment, so the population collectively represents the spatial location of the animal. In addition, the firing rate of place cells can be modulated by non-spatial (e.g., sensory or task-related) information. Not only is information conveyed in the firing rate of place cells, the precie timing of spikes with respect to the ongoing theta cycle has been hypothesized to provide a substrate for linking ordered events. A key question that arises from these facts is how the same cells organize their firing to provide two separate streams of information through two separate aspects of its firing behavior, spike rate and spike timing. During this project, analysis of in vio recordings of the hippocampus during navigation will help answer this question.  The properties of place cell firing are noticeably different depending on whether the animal is actively engaged in a task or whether it has already achieved its goal. In the latter case, place cells correspondin to locations the animal traversed on the way to its goal will often fire in events called "sharp-wave ripples," and this firing is thought to correspond to recall or memory consolidation. Considering this function of sharp-wave ripples, one might expect that place cells would continue to represent non-spatial information during these events. Further analysis of in vivo recordings of the hippocampus during sharp waves will address this possibility. Taken together, this project will expand our knowledge about the neural code used in the hippocampus during both memory formation and later recall.

Project Summary
Experience and the integration of sensory information work hand in hand to modify behavior and play
an essential role in animal survival. Taste, in particular, represents a uniquely high-risk sensory input,
as gustation is the only sense that requires ingestion in order for processing to take place. Given that
taste experiences play an important role in survival, wellbeing, and quality of life, it is imperative for
behavioral neuroscientists to understand how taste experiences alter future dietary decisions. In order
to attain this goal, we must better understand how learning impacts taste processing as well as what
regions in cortex make these behavioral adaptations possible. Malfunctions in this system result in
appetitive disorders, including over and under consumption, which often increase the risk of obesity,
depression, and diabetes.
My previous research has shown for the first time that experience with salty and sour tastes increases
aversion learning to a novel taste (Flores et al March 2016). This project aims at developing and
understanding for how the gustatory cortex and basolateral amygdala process and represent these
changes. By examining immediate early gene activity within the nucleus of neurons, I will be able to
determine what role these regions play during taste processing experiences. Neural activity in these
regions at critical time points of taste experience learning will be compared between rats who have had
previous experiences with tastes and rats having experienced water only. Additionally, regions found to
show increased levels of neural activity will undergo temporary optogenetic silencing during experience
learning to understand how lack of this cellular input alters behavioral changes observed with taste
experience learning. This new and innovative technique will deactivate neurons using a specific
wavelength of light to help decipher the functional relevance of these regions.
The results of these experiments will provide robust phenomenological evidence towards the role of
these brain regions in innocuous taste experience learning as well as how these brain areas integrate
experience into later perception. Research in this area is limited, thus an understanding of this
phenomenon will advance our current understanding of taste processing on a level that is more
generalizable to the widely diverse human taste experience.</description><investigator><investigatorId>FLORES, VERONICA L.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DC015186</grantId><grantName>Investigating the molecular and neuronal basis of olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>60432.0</amount><startDate>2015-09-16</startDate><endDate>2017-09-15</endDate><keyword>adulthood, Adult Human, 21+ years old, Adult, Hydroxyhexanes, Hexyl Alcohols, Hexanols, Algorithms, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer's Disease, Animals, Attention, Kanner's Syndrome, Infantile Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Autism, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Biologic Assays, Bioassay, Assay, Biological Assay, Factor IV, Coagulation Factor IV, Ca++ element, Blood Coagulation Factor IV, Calcium, Crowding, Cues, data interpretation, Data Analysis, Data Analyses, Disorder, Disease, Environment, Genes, Goals, Health, Modern Man, Human, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Learning, Photoradiation, Light, roundworm, Nematodes, Nematoda, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, neuroplasticity, neuroplastic, neural plasticity, CNS plasticity, Neuronal Plasticity, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Afferent Neurons, living system, Organism, Primary Parkinsonism, Parkinsons disease, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's, Parkinson, Paralysis Agitans, Parkinson Disease, Pheromone, Population Density, Research, social role, Role, schizophrenic, dementia praecox, Schizophrenic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Work, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, Sensory Disorders, Caenorhabditis elegans, C.elegans, C elegans, base, Site, Chemicals, insight, Stimulus, Nature, Complex, Sensory, System, neurodegenerative illness, degenerative neurological diseases, degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neuro-degenerative Disorders, Neural degenerative Disorders, Neural Degenerative Diseases, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, Neurodegenerative Disorders, experience, mutant, novel, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, neural function, Neurophysiology - biologic function, synaptic circuitry, synaptic circuit, neural circuitry, neural circuit, response, developmental disorder, developmental disease/disorder, Microfluidic, Microfluidics, Candidate Gene, Candidate Disease Gene, fitness, Defect, Data, Resolution, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, Behavioral, imaging, Image, pathway, Pathway interactions, stem, therapeutic target, critical period, behavioral response, behavior response, behavioral plasticity,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An organism's ability to detect and respond to environmental stimuli is critical for its survival. It is particularly important for animals to incorporate contextual information, such as internal state or external cues, in order to modify behavioral responses and maximize fitness. This behavioral plasticity has largely been studied in the context of learning or adaptation. However, how environmental cues modulate the valence of innate responses to naïve stimuli remains poorly understood. Behavioral plasticity can stem from genetic, molecular, and circuit level changes in neural function, ultimately leading to an organism's ability to thrive in a dynamic environment. The overall goal of my thesis is to investigate the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.  Preliminarily, I have found that while C. elegans grown under sparse culture conditions avoid high concentrations of the volatile chemical 1-hexanol, animals grown at high population density are instead robustly attracted to this odorant. My results indicate that this plasticity in olfactoy responses is mediated by pheromones, which may serve as a population density cue. I will exploit the experimental amenability of C. elegans to identify the genes, neurons and circuits that underlie the responses to 1-hexanol, and investigate how these responses are modified by contextual cues and experience. To do so, I will utilize a novel quantitative approach and high-resolution data analysis algorithms.  Insights from this research will shed light on conserved molecular and neuronal pathways involved in sensory plasticity. Many neurological disorders-from developmental disorders such as autism to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's-stem from underlying deficits in neuroplasticity. Therefore, in addition to understanding the mechanisms of plasticity in a healthy context, this work has important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease states.</description><investigator><investigatorId>HARTMANN, ANNA H.</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DC015155</grantId><grantName>The Molecular Basis of Hygrosensation in Insects</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>77614.4</amount><startDate>2016-02-01</startDate><endDate>2018-08-31</endDate><keyword>Aedes, Affect, Air, Alleles, Allelomorphs, Animals, Awareness, Behavior, Biology, Body Water, Complementary DNA, cDNA, Carbon Dioxide, Carbonic Anhydride, CO2, Cells, Cell Body, Chemoreceptors, cold temperature, low temperature, Cues, Cessation of life, Death, Dehydration, body water dehydration, Desiccation, Dessication, Disease, Disorder, Disease Vectors, Drosophila melanogaster, Ecology, Environmental Science, Environment, Equilibrium, balance function, balance, Female, Foundations, Genes, Health, Homeostasis, Physiological Homeostasis, Autoregulation, Housing, Human, Modern Man, Humidity, Industry, Insect Vectors, Insecta, Insects Invertebrates, Insects, Mechanoreceptors, Culicidae, Mosquitoes, Neurons, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Afferent Neurons, Sensory Neurons, Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron, Neurosciences, Oviposition, Pathology, Pest Control, Physiology, pressure, Proteins, Public Health, Role, social role, Esthesia, Sensation, Specificity, Temperature, Testing, Thermoreceptors, temperature receptor, Water, Hydrogen Oxide, Work, Molecular Genetics, Mediating, sensor, Site, Area, Surface, Physiologic, Physiological, insight, Stimulus, Genetic, tool, Nature, Life, Sensory, preference, evaporation, field study, field test, field learning, field based data, mechanical pressure, mutant, Protein Isoforms, Isoforms, receptor, Receptor Protein, sensory mechanism, insect disease, novel, sensory system, Modality, Modeling, Property, response, Habitats, theories, prevent, preventing, Hydration status, Hydration, Address, Co-Immunoprecipitations, Data, Detection, Ectopic Expression, Molecular, Behavioral, Flies, fly, water vapor, vector, global climate change, climate change, Population, human disease, public health relevance, CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Water is an essential component of all life, and maintaining water balance is a key component of physiological homeostasis. The humidity of the air determines how rapidly water evaporates, and is thus a critical environmental variable. Insects are particularly vulnerable to changes in body water from evaporation because of their small size and large surface area to volume ratio, and so possess sensitive hygro-sensory systems that allow them to seek out environments of appropriate moisture and avoid excessively dry or moist regions. From a human health perspective, insect disease vectors use hygrosensing to locate hosts. Field studies indicate that moisture can be as powerful an attractive cue for Aedes females, as temperature and carbon dioxide. Despite the importance of hygrosensing to human health and insect biology, its molecular and cellular basis remains poorly understood. While humidity is a function of the concentration of water vapor, the key humidity-dependent parameter that governs hygrosensory responses has remained elusive. Three distinct humidity-dependent stimuli: evaporation rate, moisture-dependent pressure changes and evaporative cooling have each been proposed to underlie hygrosensation. In each model, the stimulus would activate a distinct sensory modality, evaporation rate activating chemoreceptors, pressure activating mechanoreceptors and cooling activating thermoreceptors. However, the precise stimulus or combination of stimuli involved is unclear. Our preliminary data suggests functional overlap between the molecular sensors required for sensing moisture and cold temperatures. My work not only provides a foundation for identification of molecular cold and moisture sensors, but also suggests that awareness of cooling may be critical to hygrosensing. I propose to begin to identify the underlying basis of hygrosensing by further elucidating the critical receptors for moisture in Drosophila melanogaster and using the molecular genetic tools of the fly to probe their molecular and cellular properties. This work addresses basic questions in neuroscience and sensory biology, with relevance to the survival of insect vectors of human disease and their ability to seek hosts.</description><investigator><investigatorId>KNECHT, ZACHARY </investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DC012298</grantId><grantName>The hidden consequences of difficult speech perception for memory</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>52408.0</amount><startDate>2012-04-01</startDate><endDate>2014-03-31</endDate><keyword>Accounting, Affect, senior citizen, over 65 Elderly, older person, older adult, later life, late life, geriatric, elders, advanced age, Aged 65 and Over, Elderly, Auditory Perception, chronic disorder, chronic disease/disorder, Chronic Illness, Chronic Disease, Cognition, Communication, virtual simulation, in silico, computerized simulation, computerized modeling, computer based models, computational simulation, computational models, computational modeling, Mathematical Models and Simulations, Mathematical Model Simulation, Computerized Models, Computer based Simulation, Computer Models, Computer Simulation, Diagnosis, Goals, sound perception, hearing perception, Hearing, Language, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Learning, Masks, Memory, Noise, Perception, Probability, Research, social role, Role, Semantics, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, sound, Speech, Speech Perception, Technology, Testing, Verbal Learning, Work, Measures, Comprehension, base, juvenile human, juvenile, Adolescent Youth, Adolescent, Link, Ensure, Memory Deficit, Memory impairment, Stimulus, Individual, young adulthood, adult youth, young adult, hearing disease, Hearing Disorders, Hearing problem, Shapes, Pattern, interest, experience, Performance, Structure, memory process, Participant, experimental study, experimental research, experiment, research study, Modeling, theories, Hypoacusis, Hypoacuses, Hearing Loss, hearing impairment, Address, Length, Measurable, Retrieval, trend, Process, Behavioral, Output, Population, Impairment, normal aging, efficacy testing,</keyword><description>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing difficulties - whether caused by hearing loss or irrelevant ambient noise - can affect more than one's ability to identify speech; when a stimulus is difficult to perceive, memory for that stimulus suffers [47]. Indeed, this memory detriment is present even when the stimulus has been correctly identified [32, 40]. To determine how this effect arises, we examined the role of difficult perception in recall for word-lists [38]. 
Participants listened to lists where a single word within a list was acoustically masked, and were then asked to recall the lists. The level of masking was adjusted such that the masked word was difficult, but not impossible, to identify. This masking reduced the recall probability for the masked word and, of particular interest, for the non-masked word prior to the masked. These results revealed that difficult listening negatively affects memory for previous, non-degraded speech, as well as for the degraded information itself. Further analysis suggested that this reduction in recall probability was due to a disrupted output pattern. During normal recall, subjects have a strong tendency to follow recall of any word with the word that directly followed it during presentation. This is thought to be due to associations formed between neighboring words during listening. These associations are followed during recall, thereby aiding memory for the list. However, this pattern is disrupted when a masked word is present; there is a reduced probability of following these associations to the masked word, and to words prior to the masked. To provide a mechanism for this effect, we matched the behavioral results to a preliminary computational model. My goal is to formulate an account of associations formed during listening, disrupted by perceptual difficulty, and utilized during recall. I first aim to substantiate the theory that perceptual difficulty alters the formation of associations between words. I will do this by challenging our model against alternative accounts of recall impairment due to poor perception. Second, I will elucidate the structure of the association deficits that come with perceptual difficulty, thereby providing a mechanism for understanding the subtle but important effects of hearing quality on memory for speech. Because the effect of difficult perception has implications beyond list-learning impairment, my final aim is to determine whether association models can account for recall of meaningful materials and passages.</description><investigator><investigatorId>COUSINS, KATHERYN ALEXANDRA QUILICO</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>F31DA040402</grantId><grantName>Effects of federal parity legislationon access to drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>53144.0</amount><startDate>2016-08-01</startDate><endDate>2018-07-31</endDate><keyword>Affect, Alcohol Chemical Class, Alcohols, Awareness, psychological disorder, psychiatric illness, mental illness, Psychiatric Disorder, Psychiatric Disease, Mental health disorders, Mental disorders, Color, Communities, Data Sources, Cognitive Discrimination, Discrimination, drug/agent, Pharmaceutic Preparations, Medication, Drugs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Experimental Designs, Future, Health, treatment provider, medical personnel, healthcare personnel, health provider, health care worker, health care personnel, Healthcare worker, Healthcare Providers, Health Care Providers, Health Personnel, Health Planning, healthcare policy, health care policy, Health Policy, treatment access, health services availability, health service access, care access, availability of services, accessibility to health services, access to treatment, access to services, access to health services, Access to Care, Health Services Accessibility, Institute of Medicine (U.S.), NAS/IOM, Institute of Medicine, Insurance, Insurance Benefits, Insurance Carriers, Insurers, Health Insurance, Laws, Lead, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Mental Health, Psychological Health, Mental Hygiene, parity, Play, Privatization, health care quality, healthcare quality, Records, Research, Resources, Research Resources, Role, social role, Societies, Substance Use Disorder, Surveys, Survey Instrument, Testing, Time, Measures, Treatment outcome, Care Givers, Caregivers, health care, Healthcare, Mediating, doubt, Uncertainty, Caring, base, improved, Medical, Series, total medical expenditure, medical expenses not covered by insurance, Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense, Uncovered Medical Expenses, Out-of-Pocket Expense, Uninsured Medical Expense, Individual, drug use, Drug usage, Respondent, cooking, Insurance Coverage, Insurance Status, Side, Source, contextual factors, Application Context, Operative Surgical Procedures, surgery, Surgical Procedure, Surgical Interventions, Surgical, Operative Procedures, Services, health care model, payment, Regulation, Modeling, social stigma, stigma, Intervention, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Provider, Effectiveness, prevent, preventing, Address, Data, Science Policy, trend, cost, consumer demand, health economics, designing, design, Outcome, Prevalence, ethnic minority population, ethnic minority, racial and ethnic, addiction, addictive disorder, racial and ethnic disparities, high risk, public health relevance, care recipients, care receiver, ethnic health disparity, disparity reduction, reduce disparity, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Health Care Research, healthcare research, secondary analysis,</keyword><description>﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, insurance coverage for drug, alcohol, and mental health (DAMH) care has been more limited than coverage for other forms of general health care. For decades, insurers defended this difference with arguments that equal coverage for DAMH care would lead to excessive use and high costs. More restrictive coverage has contributed over time to a large treatment gap in which most people in need of DAMH care have not received it. For those who have received care, financial protection has tended to be weaker. Since the 1990s, a series of state and federal laws have attempted to regulate insurance and mandate DAMH parity. One of the most comprehensive efforts has been the 2008 Paul Wellstone &amp; Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity &amp; Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). This federal law seeks to strengthen private insurance coverage for DAMH care, but its effectiveness to date remains largely unknown. The purpose of this project is: (1) to investigate the effects of MHPAEA on how people access and pay for DAMH care; and (2) to measure racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care and assess how MHPAEA has affected them. Principles of health economics predict MHPAEA will improve financial protection for DAMH care recipients, reducing uncertainty about out-of-pocket expenses and limiting risk for high, potentially catastrophic costs. Another less probable outcome is that MHPAEA will increase DAMH treatment rates as better coverage makes care more affordable. According to the Institute of Medicine model of health care disparities, however, institutional factors and discrimination may intervene to perpetuate and potentially deepen racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care despite the new protections afforded by MHPAEA. To research these issues, this study will employ a quasi-experimental design using secondary analysis of existing data. Difference-in-differences models will be fit with pooled independent cross sections of survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2004-2013. Treatment rates and payment sources will be compared pre- and post-MHPAEA, testing multiple time-points post-MHPAEA to detect effects of staggered implementation. Survey respondents with private insurance will be compared to those with public sources of insurance and those without insurance. Generalized linear mixed models will be estimated to allow for analysis of individual-level observations clustered within states. The proposed research will produce preliminary empirical evidence on the effectiveness of MHPAEA. Results will be representative at state and national levels. Findings will contribute to an improved understanding of the role health insurance plays in determining how consumers access DAMH care. Findings may also inform future efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in DAMH care and the overall DAMH treatment gap. As other research assesses the effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act on access to DAMH treatment, the proposed study will provide a strong baseline evidence upon which to build.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between state-level Marijuana Expansion Policy (MEP) changes and trends in adolescent marijuana and alcohol use in adolescents. This study will: (1) evaluate available data resources and prepare a dataset containing the necessary variables for analyses, (2) determine adolescent marijuana, alcohol and alcohol/marijuana co-use estimates for 1993-2011, and (3) assess: (a) the effect of MEP(a) and MEP components on trends in report of marijuana, alcohol, and co-use and (b) MEP components that associate with trends in report of marijuana, alcohol, and co-use. The primary marijuana and alcohol outcomes of interest are: 1) lifetime use prevalence and quantity; 2) past-30-day use prevalence and quantity; 3) age of initiation; and 4) past 30-day concurrent alcohol and marijuana use prevalence.  Descriptive analyses, factor analyses and multilevel modeling will be employed in this study. Once all variables are constructed, the YRBSS specific marijuana, alcohol, and co-use trends will be examined using univariate statistics and bivariate analyses. As part of variable construction, factor analyses wil be used to construct one or more factors categorizing the various components of decriminalization and medical marijuana policies and tested as alternatives to individual MEPs indicators in the models. Multilevel Modeling (MLM) will be used to control for correlation among clusters and complex patterns of variability within the hierarchy of individual adolescents nested within both states and years. Multilevel modeling assists in the exploration of: (1) relationships at multiple levels of analysis and (2) cross-level interactions.  It is theorized that MEPs will afect adolescent marijuana consumption by influencing price, availability, norms, perceptions, and social sanctions. The study hypothesizes that changes in state MEP(s) will be associated with higher report of adolescent marijuana use. A better understanding how varying MEP(s) may affect adolescent marijuana, alcohol, and co-use will help us understand when and how best to prevent and intervene effectively. The results from this study will assist to identify MEP(s) and MEPs policy components that are associated with adolescent marijuana, alcohol and co-use use. This knowledge will lend itself to the development of targeted prevention and interventions.  Training under this fellowship would build on Ms. Johnson's previous methodological and analytical skills cultivated in coursework and related research experience to ensure rigorous and timely study completion. The training plan will build develop and hone expertise in: (1) working with secondary data (e.g. assessment of YRBSS datasets, missing data etc.), (2) data management (e.g. constructing necessary variables, merging multiple datasets etc.), (3) quantitative analytical methods (multilevel modeling, factor analyses), (4) theory and (5) research dissemination (e.g. writing abstracts and manuscripts for professional meetings and manuscript publication, networking with researchers etc.).

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall structure and function of the central nervous system is established via a variety of carefully orchestrated processes, including the formation of synapses and the morphogenesis of the dendritic arborization of individual neurons. These processes are subject to influence by external factors, including the changes in neuronal activity that occur in response to the administration of drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine, and opiates. Recently, the small GTPase Rem2 was identified as a novel regulator of excitatory synapse development, dendritic spine formation, and dendritic arbor morphology. Additionally, the ability of Rem2 to mediate dendritic morphology is dependent on Rem2 binding to calmodulin (CaM). Interestingly, Rem2 is upregulated at the transcriptional level in response to neuronal depolarization, suggesting that it can act as a direc link by which a neuron can respond to changes in activity by altering its structure and function as needed.  This proposal seeks to explore the signaling mechanisms through which Rem2 mediates dendritic arborization in response to changes in neuronal activity both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, an in vitro system of cultured rodent hippocampal neurons will be used to explore the interaction of Rem2 with CaM kinase II, as existing data suggests that Rem2 is downstream of this known regulator of dendritic morphology. To explore the role of Rem2 in such activity-dependent changes in morphology in vivo, the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, a well-characterized experimental system, will be used to identify how Rem2 participates in the morphological changes caused by activity in the form of visual sensory experience.  Importantly, Rem2 is expressed in the striatum, which is the site of action of the reward attributes associated with drug addiction, as well as the hippocampus, which has been shown to undergo structural changes in response to amphetamines. Changes in CaM kinase signaling have also been extensively implicated in opiate addiction. Thus, a comprehensive study of the signaling pathways in which Rem2 is involved will provide new insights into how the underlying structure of the brain is altered to produce the functional changes associated with drug use and addiction. Ultimately, Rem2 may represent a key molecule through which external stimuli mediate direct effects on those signaling pathways that regulate the structure of individual neurons and the central nervous system as a whole.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in retaining existing staff and recruiting new staff impact the quality of care that an alcohol or other drug treatment facility is able to deliver. To date, few research studies have focused on the addiction treatment workforce (ATW). Drawing on past research from the addiction treatment field, the field of nursing, and the field of nursing home care, this study seeks to examine the counselor's work environment, taking into consideration the impact of the facility specific context on the behavior of the counselor's employed within each facility, and relating these factors to quality of care measures generated at the facility level. The questions guiding this research are: (1) how does perception of work environment vary at the individual counselor level?, (2) how do perceptions of work environment vary across facilities?, (3) do counselor perceptions of facility level work environment impact staff turnover?, and (4) is there an association between counselor perceptions of facility work environment and the quality of care produced at the facility level?  The theories informing this research include: (1) Social Exchange Theory and the Norm of Reciprocity which predict the behavior of individuals within organizations; (2) Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) which predicts the behavior of an organization, in this case the outpatient treatment facility, in regards to its compensation package, organizational structure, and the provision of organizational supports to staff working within the facility; and (3) Donabedian's quality of care paradigm which recognizes the impact of structure and process measures within a facility as having a direct influence on the quality of care being generated.  By focusing on the addiction treatment counselors and their workplace, this research creates an opportunity to gain new knowledge, as well as important and valuable insights about the counselors, their work environment, and the challenges and barriers they face as they seek to deliver quality care. This new knowledge could be used in the development of sustainable and reproducible interventions or strategies that can address the real-world challenges and barriers to quality care that exist, and result in improved treatment outcomes for the patients seeking care, as well as an improved quality of life for both patients and counselors.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Difficulties in retaining existing staff and recruiting new staff impact the quality of care that substance abuse treatment facility is able to deliver. The proposed research will expand what is known about the addiction treatment workforce, and its linkage with quality. Further, this research has the potential to provide the field with an actionable set of workforce policy recommendations that will assist us in the development of a sustainable response to the core workforce issues of recruitment, retention, and stigma.

At the same time, care for patients with these disorders can be difficult to access, uncoordinated, and not evidence-based. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) presents an enormous opportunity for AOD treatment through expansion of insurance coverage to populations that disproportionately include individuals with AOD use disorders, the scope of AOD treatment benefits, and delivery system reforms.  The ACA and many states' health care reforms also foster the implementation of new ways to pay health care providers in order to drive delivery system innovations and improvements in patients' health and health care. Bundled payments, a predetermined fee or budget that includes the prices of a group of services that would typically treat an episode of care in a defined period of time, are considered one of the most promising new payment models. Under bundled payments, providers are more responsible for patients' clinical management and costs, which may affect organizational revenue and organizational behavioral responses (e.g., access to care, number of services provided). Bundled payments are associated with reductions in health care spending and utilization and may improve care coordination and the implementation of evidence-based practices. However, bundled payments have not yet been developed for AOD treatment.  This application proposes a study to design and simulate the impact of bundled payments for alcohol treatment to understand which bundled payments are effective and feasible to implement to pay for episodes of care experienced by individuals with alcohol use disorders. This study uses an exploratory sequential mixed- methods design to (1) obtain input from AOD treatment organizations' on design of episodes of care and bundled payments, (2) design alcohol bundled payments using organizational input and heath care claims and administrative data, and (3) predict the impact of alcohol bundled payments on organizational revenues and organizational behavioral responses. The data sources for this project are group interviews with financial, clinical, and executive leaders at AOD treatment organizations and 2010-2013 Medicaid claims and administrative data.  Bundled payments for alcohol treatment have the potential to improve care coordination, implementation of evidence-based practices, and engagement in outpatient treatment; reduce readmissions to detox; make care more patient-centered; and cover treatment services that are not traditionally reimbursed. The results of this study will illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of bundled payments for alcohol treatment. The bundled payments designed in this project are the first for alcohol treatment and have the potential to be used in health care practice and in further research to improve the health and health care of individuals with alcohol use disorders.</description><investigator><investigatorId>QUINN, AMITY ELIZABETH</investigatorId></investigator></grant><grant><grantId>DP2NS082127</grantId><grantName>Activity-dependent regulation of membrane traffic and growth signaling in neurons</grantName><funderCode>75</funderCode><funderAgency>National Institutes of Health</funderAgency><amount>2429272.0</amount><startDate>2012-09-30</startDate><endDate>2017-06-30</endDate><keyword>abstracting, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, primary degenerative dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia, Alzheimers disease, Alzheimers Dementia, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer syndrome, Alzheimer sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Type Dementia, Alzheimer, Alzheimer's Disease, Lou Gehrig Disease, Gehrig's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Engineering / Architecture, Architecture, plasmalemma, Plasma Membrane, Cytoplasmic Membrane, Cell membrane, Cells, Cues, fruit fly, Drosophila, Drosophila genus, Exhibits, ontogeny, Tissue Growth, Generalized Growth, Growth, heavy metal lead, heavy metal Pb, Pb element, Lead, Learning, Memory, neurological disease, Neurological Disorders, Neurologic Disorders, Nervous System Diseases, nervous system disorder, Myoneural Junction, Neuromuscular Junction, neuronal, Neurocyte, Neural Cell, Nerve Unit, Nerve Cells, Neurons, biological signal transduction, Signaling, Signal Transduction Systems, Intracellular Communication and Signaling, Cell Signaling, Cell Communication and Signaling, Signal Transduction, synapse, Synaptic, Synapses, Synaptic Vesicles, Testing, Work, Acute, Chronic, Morphology, Life, Complex, Event, Route, LOINC Axis 4 System, System, Location, neurodegenerative illness, Neurologic Degenerative Conditions, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Nervous System Degenerative Diseases, Degenerative Neurologic Disorders, Degenerative Neurologic Diseases, Neurodegenerative Disorders, Cellular Regulation, cell growth regulation, membrane structure, Membrane, Receptor Protein, receptor, receptor internalization, trafficking, Structure, Regulation, Modeling, LOINC Axis 2 Property, Property, response, Proteomics, interventional strategy, Intervention Strategies, Intervention, Molecular Interaction, Binding, Binding (Molecular Function), Defect, Membrane Traffic, Membrane Protein Traffic, Receptor Signaling, in vivo, Molecular, Process, developmental, Development, imaging, Image, presynaptic, public health relevance,</keyword><description>   
DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   
Abstract: Neurons grow elaborate structures tailored to send and receive electrical signals over large distances and through complex networks of connections. Neuronal morphology in these networks changes dynamically in response to both neuronal firing and external growth cues, during development as well as learning and memory, and recedes in the absence of positive growth cues. These growth cues are transduced by receptors that exhibit subcellular location-dependent signaling properties as they are internalized from the plasma membrane and trafficked through endosomal compartments, and therefore regulation of membrane traffic can profoundly alter growth signaling. The intersection of signaling and membrane traffic is particularly intriguing in the presynaptic compartment of neurons, because synapses are highly specialized for both exocytic and endocytic traffic of synaptic vesicles in response to activity. Signaling receptor internalization and the synaptic vesicle cycle use a highly overlapping set of trafficking machinery, but little is understood about cross-talk between these processes and how activity-dependent modes of regulation of trafficking machinery might be used to control signal transduction. These membrane trafficking events are deeply implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and understanding how they are regulated by neuron-specific mechanisms may lead to new routes for intervention.  We are using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which activity-dependent changes in receptor traffic lead to changes in synaptic growth signaling and synaptic architecture. This proposal combines two approaches to determining how receptor traffic in this system is regulated by activity: (1) live imaging of signaling receptor traffic and in response to chronic and acute changes in activity, and (2) proteomic analyses of activity-dependent changes in the membrane traffic machinery. We will then combine our findings about molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent regulation of endocytic traffic with in vivo tests of traffic of synaptic growth receptor, leading to models for how activity works through the membrane traffic machinery to tune signaling up or down for structural remodeling of neurons, and for how mis-regulation of these cellular trafficking events might contribute to neurodegenerative disease.   
Public Health Relevance: Neurons undergo dynamic structural changes in response to external growth signals during development as well as learning and memory. Growth signals are trafficked into the cell via membrane-bound compartments, and defects in these events are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. We propose to investigate how neurons control the formation of membrane compartments and load them with specific signaling cargoes, and identify ways to manipulate these events to treat neurological disease.

Influenza, ebola, dengue and zika are only a few of the viruses which caused past or ongoing pandemics and
threaten recurrence. All of these viruses package their infectious genomes in a cell-derived membrane
envelope decorated with viral proteins that mediate infectious cell entry. Due to pressures for mechanistic
economy imposed by their small size, viruses often combine in a single protein different interdependent
functions. Yet they retain extreme adaptability – they evolve rapidly under changing conditions. Viral cell-entry
proteins combine distinct protein domains with membrane fusion and target cell attachment functions.
Membrane fusion delivers viral genomes to the cell interior by merging the viral envelope with a cell
membrane. The attachment domains bring viruses to the fusion target. They also serve to stabilize fusion
domains in the extracellular environment, which retards fusion within endosomes (sites of fusion inside cells) –
they act as fusion repressors. Thus productive cell entry requires a delicate balance of protein's stability and
functional plasticity. One source of changing external pressures on cell entry are neutralizing antibodies
produced by the immune system. Another source are mechanistic pressures of zoonotic adaptations, when
entry proteins adjust preference from animal to human receptors, and alter fusion protein stability as required
for human-to-human transmission. How is the extreme adaptability achieved by a system that is constrained
both by the changing environment and mechanistic economy? In my past work, I achieved unprecedented,
molecular-level resolution of influenza membrane fusion by combining 1) single-virion real-time imaging of
membrane fusion of authentic virions with planar membrane bilayers, 2) computational and theoretical
modeling of time-delay distributions to various fusion intermediates, and 3) structure-based mutagenesis. This
work offered the first glimpse into how adaptability of membrane fusion might be achieved through combined
action among multiple fusion proteins on a virus. Hundreds of fusion proteins on a single influenza virus
particle contact the target membrane, but only several neighboring ones mediate fusion. I have identified
independent avenues available to influenza to fine-tune fusion, two of which affect either the available pool of
active fusion proteins on the virion surface or the required number of fusion-protein neighbors. In this proposal,
I seek to 1) determine the molecular mechanisms allowing adaptation of the interdependent cell-entry functions
of influenza, and 2) define the constraints limiting evolvability of the influenza virus cell-entry functions. I will
build upon my combined approaches to enable a holistic molecular picture of membrane fusion and membrane
attachment/fusion-repression functions of intact HAs on authentic virions and in near native conditions of
purified endosomes. By defining evolutionary rules, entry-protein functional changes, and their co-dependence,
we might improve our predictive ability for viral strains with high pandemic potential. Fundamental principles
deduced for influenza are likely to extend to other viral cell-entry systems.
