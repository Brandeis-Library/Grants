TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, I WILL USE THE BUDDING YEAST S. CEREVISIAE, WHERE SEPTINS WERE FIRST DISCOVERED, AND WHERE I AM READILY ABLE TO COMBINE A ‘BOTTOM UP’ IN VITRO RECONSTITUTION AND SINGLE MOLECULE IMAGING APPROACH WITH A ‘TOP DOWN’ GENETICS AND LIVE IMAGING APPROACH. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS OFF OF RECENT DISCOVERIES MADE IN THE GOODE LAB, WHICH REVEAL THAT SEPTINS ARE ORGANIZED AT THE YEAST BUD NECK INTO 8-10 EVENLY-SPACED BARS, OR “PILLARS”, WHICH CO-ALIGN WITH F-ACTIN CABLES USED FOR INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT. WHILE WORK IN A NUMBER OF MODEL ORGANISMS HAS CLOSELY LINKED THE IN VIVO FUNCTIONS OF SEPTINS AND ACTIN, WE STILL HAVE ONLY A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS SEPTIN-ACTIN CROSSTALK. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEFINE THESE MECHANISMS. S. CEREVISIAE EXPRESS 5 DIFFERENT SEPTIN PROTEINS, WHICH CO-POLYMERIZE INTO FILAMENTS AND ARE FURTHER ORGANIZED INTO HIGHER ORDER STRUCTURES. MY PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT ONE OF THE SEPTINS (SHS1) MEDIATES DIRECT BINDING TO F-ACTIN IN VITRO, AND THAT LOSS OF SHS1 DISRUPTS ACTIN CABLE ARCHITECTURE AND FUNCTION IN VIVO. IN AIM1, I WILL USE TARGETED MUTAGENESIS TO GENERATE NEW SHS1 SEPARATION-OF-FUNCTION MUTANTS DISRUPTING F-ACTIN BINDING. I WILL THEN USE THESE MUTANTS TO INVESTIGATE HOW SHS1-MEDIATED F-ACTIN BINDING CONTRIBUTES TO THE ALIGNMENT OF ACTIN CABLES WITH SEPTIN PILLARS IN VIVO, AND INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT OF SECRETORY VESICLES. IN AIM2, I WILL RECONSTITUTE PURIFIED SEPTIN OLIGOMERS AND FILAMENTS DECORATED WITH ACTIN- NUCLEATING FORMINS (BNR1) AND FORMIN-REGULATORY PROTEINS (E.G., GIN4, BUD6, AND THE MLC1-IQG1-HOF1 COMPLEX), AND DEFINE THEIR EFFECTS ON F-ACTIN ASSEMBLY AND ORGANIZATION BY TIRF MICROSCOPY AND SINGLE MOLECULE IMAGING. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST SEVERAL IMPORTANT HYPOTHESES, INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER SEPTINS AND GIN4 ACTIVATE FULL- LENGTH BNR1 FROM AUTOINHIBITION TO PROMOTE ACTIN ASSEMBLY; (2) WHETHER IQG1 HAS REGULATORY EFFECTS ON F-ACTIN AND BNR1, LIKE ITS HUMAN COUNTERPART IQGAP1 (BASED ON A RECENT STUDY FROM THE GOODE LAB; HOEPRICH ET AL., 2022); AND (3) WHETHER SEPTIN OLIGOMERS/FILAMENTS THEMSELVES (VIA SHS1) DIRECTLY INFLUENCE F-ACTIN BUNDLING AND DYNAMICS. IN PARALLEL TO THESE IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS, I WILL ACUTELY DEPLETE THE SAME PROTEINS IN VIVO (USING DEGRON TAGS) TO DETERMINE HOW EACH CONTRIBUTES TO THE ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT OF ACTIN CABLES AT THE BUD NECK. MY PRELIMINARY DATA ALREADY POINT TO AN EXCITING NEW ROLE FOR IQG1 IN CONTROLLING ACTIN CABLE FORMATION DURING POLARIZED CELL GROWTH. TOGETHER, THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO WORK OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL: (I) CLARIFY HOW SEPTINS, FORMINS, AND FORMIN-REGULATORY PROTEINS WORK IN CONCERT TO SHAPE ACTIN NETWORKS, (II) DEFINE NEW SUBUNIT-SPECIFIC ROLES FOR SEPTINS IN ACTIN REGULATION, (III) LAY A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN LAB FOCUSED ON SEPTIN-ACTIN CROSSTALK, AND (IV) PROVIDE NEW LEADS THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO EXTEND THIS WORK IN THE FUTURE (ON MY OWN AND VIA COLLABORATION) INTO OTHER SYSTEMS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F32GM150204_7529/,2023-05-19

MANY SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES IN BIOLOGY ARE ?SELF-LIMITED?, MEANING THAT ASSEMBLY AUTOMATICALLY STOPS AT A PARTICULAR SIZE AND STRUCTURE. THESE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLIES PERFORM IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN BIOLOGICAL CELLS, AND THUS UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY WORK WOULD ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND DISEASES. MOREOVER, LEARNING TO DESIGN SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY PROCESSES IN SYNTHETIC SYSTEMS COULD ENABLE IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THE ACHIEVABLE SIZES AND YIELDS OF ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES ARE CURRENTLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF NATURAL SYSTEMS. THIS LIMITATION ARISES BECAUSE THE FIELD LACKS THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE DESIGNING THE SUBUNITS AND REACTION CONDITIONS TO ENSURE ROBUST, EFFICIENT ASSEMBLY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP SUCH THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES, BY USING COMPUTATION AND THEORY TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT BIOLOGY USES MAKE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY EFFICIENT, AND TO LEARN HOW TO APPLY THEM TO SYNTHETIC ASSEMBLIES. THE PROJECT WILL UNDERTAKE THREE THRUSTS, EACH OF WHICH INVESTIGATES A DIFFERENT MECHANISM. THE FIRST THRUST WILL STUDY HOW USING MULTIPLE SPECIES OF SUBUNITS WITH DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS CAN INCREASE ACHIEVABLE ASSEMBLY SIZES AND YIELD. THE SECOND THRUST WILL INVESTIGATE HOW VARYING REACTION CONDITIONS IN TIME CAN INCREASE ASSEMBLY RATES AND YIELDS. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL COMBINE NEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS WITH A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK CALLED OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE TIME-SEQUENCES OF REACTION CONDITIONS THAT MAXIMIZE YIELDS. THE THIRD THRUST WILL STUDY SELF-ASSEMBLY WITHIN PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS. LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION REFERS TO THE DE-MIXING OF A SOLUTION INTO DROPLETS WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, SUCH AS WHEN OIL AND WATER SEPARATE. DURING SOME VIRUS INFECTIONS, THE VIRUS REMODELS ITS HOST CELL TO FORM PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS WITHIN WHICH NEW VIRAL PARTICLES ASSEMBLE. THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY HOW ASSEMBLY RATES AND YIELDS DEPEND ON PROPERTIES OF THE PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS, SUCH AS THEIR SIZE AND THE TENDENCY OF SUBUNITS TO LOCALLY CONCENTRATE INSIDE OF THE DROPLETS. RESULTS FROM EACH THRUST WILL BE TESTED AGAINST EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED BY COLLABORATORS, IN WHICH DNA ORIGAMI OR PROTEIN DESIGN IS USED TO CREATE SUBUNITS THAT ASSEMBLE INTO SYMMETRIC SHELLS, HELICAL TUBULES, AND OTHER STRUCTURES. THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICAL (STEM) TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RECRUIT DIVERSE STUDENTS, AND TRAIN THEM IN COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION TO EXPERT AND NON-EXPERT AUDIENCES. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE PROGRAMS IN WHICH THE RESEARCHERS DESCRIBE THEIR RESULTS TO THE PUBLIC. THESE EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A PROGRAM INTEGRATED IN THE PHYSICS CURRICULUM OF A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL, IN WHICH STUDENTS ENGAGE IN A HANDS-ON ACTIVITY THAT EXPLAINS THE PHYSICS AND GEOMETRY OF SELF-ASSEMBLY IN VIRUSES AND TECHNOLOGY, WHILE CONVEYING THE WONDER, EXCITEMENT, AND IMPACT ON SOCIETY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY OF PROTEIN SUBUNITS INTO FINITE-SIZED STRUCTURES WITH WELL-DEFINED ARCHITECTURES IS A HALLMARK OF LIFE. SUCH STRUCTURES ABOUND IN NATURE, WHERE THEY PERFORM ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF CELLS AND THE PATHOGENS THAT INFECT THEM. RECENTLY, ADVANCES IN DNA ORIGAMI AND PROTEIN DESIGN HAVE ENABLED ENGINEERING SYNTHETIC SUBUNITS THAT ARE PROGRAMMED FOR SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY, WITH ATOMIC-SCALE PRECISION RIVALING THAT OF NATURAL PROTEINS. YET, ACHIEVABLE SIZES AND YIELDS OF ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES FALL FAR SHORT OF NATURE, DUE TO A LACK OF THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE DESIGNING SUBUNITS AND REACTION CONDITIONS FOR ROBUST, EFFICIENT ASSEMBLY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, BY USING COMPUTATION TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT BIOLOGY USES TO CIRCUMVENT CONSTRAINTS ON ASSEMBLY TIMESCALES: TUNABLE ?SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY?, BY HAVING MULTIPLE SUBUNIT SPECIES WITH SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS, AND NONEQUILIBRIUM SPATIOTEMPORALLY VARYING ASSEMBLY DRIVING FORCES. THE PROJECT WILL UNDERTAKE THREE COMPLEMENTARY THRUSTS. THRUST 1 INVESTIGATES HOW SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY DEPENDS ON SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY, TO IDENTIFY GENERAL STRATEGIES TO INCREASE YIELDS. THRUST 2 COMBINES MARKOV STATE MODELS WITH OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS FOR OPTIMIZING TIME-DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY PROTOCOLS. THRUST 3 WILL USE SIMULATIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SELF-ASSEMBLY IS AFFECTED BY A PROMINENT FORM OF SPATIAL CONTROL IN CELLS ? LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION. THE RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE HOW LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION CAN ACCELERATE ASSEMBLY AND ENHANCE ROBUSTNESS AGAINST PARAMETER VARIATIONS. RESULTS FROM EACH THRUST WILL BE TESTED AGAINST EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED BY COLLABORATORS, IN WHICH DNA ORIGAMI OR PROTEIN DESIGN IS USED TO CREATE SUBUNITS THAT ASSEMBLE INTO ICOSAHEDRAL CAPSIDS, HELICAL TUBULES, AND OTHER STRUCTURES. ASSEMBLING LARGE TARGET STRUCTURES IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE ASSEMBLY RATES ARE CONSTRAINED BY COMPETING THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC EFFECTS. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY LACKS STRATEGIES TO ENGINEER ASSEMBLY REACTIONS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFY THESE TRADE-OFFS, DUE TO CRUCIAL GAPS IN SELF-ASSEMBLY THEORY: (1) PREVIOUS MODELS HAVE FOCUSED ON MINIMAL SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY (ASSEMBLY FROM ONE SUBUNIT SPECIES) OR MAXIMAL COMPLEXITY (ADDRESSABLE ASSEMBLY, IN WHICH EACH SUBUNIT IS UNIQUE); (2) OPTIMIZING TIME-DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY PROTOCOLS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN COMPUTATIONALLY INTRACTABLE FOR MOST SYSTEMS; (3) DESPITE INTENSIVE RESEARCH ON LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION, ITS EFFECT ON SELF-ASSEMBLY HAS RECEIVED RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS AND TOOLS THAT OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. THRUST 1 WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC STUDY ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY, TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY AND THE EFFECTS OF GEOMETRIC FRUSTRATION OR REDUNDANT INTERACTIONS THAT ARISE AT LOW OR HIGH COMPLEXITY. THRUST 2 WILL LEVERAGE THE PROPERTIES OF MARKOV STATE MODELS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY EFFICIENT OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK THAT IS APPLICABLE TO DIVERSE SELF-ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL TIME-DEPENDENT PROTOCOLS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY. THRUST 3 WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST MODELS FOR SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY COUPLED TO LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION. BY ESTABLISHING DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR ENGINEERING SUBUNITS THAT CAN BE PREPROGRAMMED TO ASSEMBLE INTO ARBITRARY THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES, THIS RESEARCH WILL PAVE THE WAY TO HIGHLY SCALABLE MANUFACTURING OF NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS FOR BIOMEDICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. THE RESULTS ALSO MAKE A KEY STEP TOWARD A THEORY OF LIVING MATTER, BY ELUCIDATING SELF-ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS IN BIOLOGICAL CELLS AND PATHOGENS. THE COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR THIS RESEARCH WILL BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO SELF-ASSEMBLY. THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY STEM TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SOFT MATTER PHYSICS AND CELL BIOLOGY. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL RECRUIT DIVERSE STUDENTS, AND TRAIN THEM IN COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION TO EXPERT AND NON-EXPERT AUDIENCES. PUBLIC OUTREACH WILL INCLUDE A PROGRAM INTEGRATED IN THE PHYSICS CURRICULUM OF A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL, IN WHICH STUDENTS ENGAGE IN A HANDS-ON ACTIVITY THAT EXPLAINS THE PHYSICS AND GEOMETRY OF SELF-ASSEMBLY IN VIRUSES AND TECHNOLOGY, WHILE CONVEYING THE WONDER, EXCITEMENT, AND IMPACT ON SOCIETY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

THEREFORE, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN PERTURBATION OF RNA METABOLISM AND A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THESE INCLUDE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD) IN WHICH TAU PROTEIN AND ASS42 FRAGMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INTERACT AND/OR MODULATE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RNA BINDING PROTEINS AND RNA METABOLISM IN GENERAL. CIRCULAR RNAS (CIRCRNAS) ARE HIGHLY ABUNDANT RNAS PRODUCED BY CIRCULARIZATION OF SPECIFIC EXONS. INTERESTINGLY, CIRCRNAS ACCUMULATE IN AN AGE-DEPENDENT MANNER IN NEURAL TISSUES SUGGESTING THEIR RELEVANCE TO AGE-RELATED HOMEOSTASIS AND/OR PATHOGENESIS. INDEED, SPECIFIC CIRCRNAS ACCUMULATE IN THE BRAINS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON’S AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASES. HOWEVER, HOW THESE CIRCRNAS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF THOSE AND OTHER NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMS TO DOWN- OR UP-REGULATE CIRCRNAS IN DROSOPHILA. USING THESE TOOLS, WE DEMONSTRATED THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THESE MOLECULES IN VIVO. WE GENERATED A RESOURCE TO KNOCK DOWN (KD) THE 110 MORE ABUNDANT CIRCRNAS AND FOUND THAT KD OF PARTICULAR CIRCRNAS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT BRAIN-RELATED PHENOTYPES. INTERESTINGLY, WE IDENTIFIED 35 CIRCRNAS THAT WHEN KNOCKED DOWN ALTER LIFESPAN. FURTHER DATA SHOWS THAT EXPRESSION OF SOME CIRCRNAS IS TOXIC FOR THE AGING FLY, WITH LINKS TO AGING AND POTENTIALLY NEURODEGENERATION. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT KD OF SOME CIRCRNAS LEAD TO SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL AND MOTOR DEFECTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE AGE-DEPENDENT. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVED CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF CIRCRNAS IN DROSOPHILA MODELS OF AD OR OTHER NEUROGENERATIVE DISEASES. HERE WE AIM TO UNCOVER THE FUNCTIONS AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF CIRCRNAS DURING AD. TO DO SO, WE WILL USE DROSOPHILA AD MODELS AND PERFORM A GENOMIC SCREENING TO DETERMINE IF MODULATION OF INDIVIDUAL CIRCRNAS CAN ALTER THE PROGRESSION AND OUTCOME OF THE DISEASE. MOREOVER, WE WILL ALSO TEST POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH CIRCRNAS COULD ALTER AD INCLUDING NUCLEATION OF AGGREGATES, ALTERING MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION, AUTOPHAGY, APOPTOSIS, AND/OR INFLAMMATION. IN SUM, THE PRESENT PROPOSAL WILL REVEAL NEW ROLES OF CIRCRNAS DURING AD. AS WE WILL PERFORM THE EXPERIMENTS IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS HIGH AND FUNCTIONAL LEVELS OF CIRCRNAS (THE FLY CNS) THE PRESENT RESULTS WILL BE MEANINGFUL AND COULD BE LATER EXTENDED TO MAMMALIAN MODELS. WE ARE AWARE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE AD FLY MODELS BUT THIS IS THE ONLY SYSTEM IN WHICH THE FULL EXTENT OF INTERACTION WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF CIRCRNAS CAN BE ASSESSED. MOREOVER, AS WE HAVE ALREADY FOUND THAT SOME CIRCRNAS ALTER AGING, THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE HIGH. THIS WILL BE A PIONEERING WORK IN THIS NEW AND IMPORTANT AREA OF RESEARCH AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR FINDINGS WILL OPEN A NEW PATHWAY FOR STUDYING THE ROLES OF CIRCRNAS IN AD.

BACTERIAL CELLS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO ANTIBIOTICS ACQUIRE RESISTANCE THROUGH CHANGES TO THEIR DNA SEQUENCE. PLANTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FLOWERING TIMES BASED ON THEIR TIME OF EXPOSURE TO COLD CONDITIONS. CANCER CELLS, WHEN EXPOSED TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, CAN BECOME RESISTANT, POSING A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO TREATMENT AND WORSENING PATIENT OUTCOMES.

YET POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, INCLUDING TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION AND THE ROLE OF RNA BINDING PROTEINS (RBPS), HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT IN RECENT YEARS. MOREOVER, UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF RBPS IN DIVERSE CELL TYPES AND DISEASES AND ULTIMATELY THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION REQUIRES IDENTIFYING THE RNA TARGETS OF RBPS. THE RIBOSOME CAN BE CONSIDERED A RBP, SO THIS FOCUS ON POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION AND RBP TARGETS INCLUDES IDENTIFYING RIBOSOME-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPTS, NAMELY RNAS THAT CHANGE THEIR TRANSLATIONAL STATUS UNDER DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES. RBP IDENTIFICATION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FROM SMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS, E.G., CANCER STEM CELLS WITHIN A LARGE, HETEROGENEOUS SOLID TUMOR OR DISCRETE NEURONAL SUBTYPES. THESE SETTINGS PRECLUDE TRADITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND THEREFORE REQUIRE NEW APPROACHES. TWO NEW METHODS RECENTLY APPEARED, TRIBE AND STAMP, WHICH EXPLOIT THE RNA EDITING ENZYMES ADAR AND APOBEC, RESPECTIVELY. THEIR RIBOSOME VERSIONS, RIBO-STAMP AND RIBO-TRIBE, ARE EVEN MORE RECENT AND FUSE A RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN TO THE EDITING ENZYMES. THIS IS SO THAT THE ENZYME WILL BE NEAR RNAS THAT ARE BEING TRANSLATED AND WILL “MARK” THEM BY CHANGING THEIR SEQUENCE. THESE EDITS ARE IDENTIFIED BY MRNA SEQUENCING AND STRAIGHTFORWARD COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, EVEN FROM SINGLE CELLS. WE PROPOSE TO COMPARE RIBO-STAMP AND RIBO-TRIBE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS, TO ASSESS THEIR EFFICACY AND TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION OF RIBOSOME-EDITING ENZYME FUSIONS. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO DEVELOP RIBO-TRIBE FOR USE IN DROSOPHILA; WE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT STAMP DOES NOT WORK IN THIS ORGANISM, WHICH LIMITS US TO TRIBE. WE WILL THEN EXTEND THESE METHODS TO THE MORE BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF NEURONS, FROM DROSOPHILA AS WELL AS FROM MOUSE BRAINS. TO COMPLEMENT THESE EFFORTS, WE WILL DEVELOP AN EXTENSION OF THE TRIBE/STAMP THEME CALLED NANOBODY-EDITING. IT CONSISTS OF FUSING THE EDITING ENZYME, ADAR OR APOBEC, TO A GFP-NANOBODY, WHICH WILL THEN DELIVER THE EDITING ENZYME TO ANY GFP-TAGGED RNA BINDING PROTEIN OR GFP-TAGGED RIBOSOME. THE CHIMERIC, RECOMBINANT PROTEIN WILL BE USED IN VITRO AS A RECOMBINANT PROTEIN OR EXPRESSED IN VIVO. NANOBODY- EDITING WILL FACILITATE IDENTIFYING RBP AND RIBOSOME TARGETS, BECAUSE ALREADY EXISTING GFP-TAGGED RBP OR RIBOSOMES CAN SERVE AS SUBSTRATES. MOREOVER, IN VITRO EDITING WILL IN MANY CASES OBVIATE THE NEED TO GENERATE NEW TRANSGENES AND TRANSGENIC ANIMALS. LASTLY, TRIBE AND AS WELL AS RIBO-TRIBE WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION “AROUND THE CLOCK” WITHIN A FEW KEY DROSOPHILA CIRCADIAN NEURONS.

SIMILAR DENSE SUSPENSIONS INCLUDE CEMENT, CERAMICS, AND MUD. THESE SUSPENSIONS ARE OFTEN SO PACKED WITH PARTICLES THAT SMALL CHANGES IN FLOW RATE MAY CAUSE THEM TO STOP FLOWING AND JAM INTO A SOLID. SURPRISINGLY, A PREDICTIVE THEORY FOR THIS BEHAVIOR IS LACKING. ONE OBSTACLE IS FIGURING OUT HOW INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWO PARTICLES CAUSE THE BEHAVIOR SEEN WHEN MANY PARTICLES ARE PUT TOGETHER. THE RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY THIS AWARD IS FOCUSED ON CREATING UNDERSTANDING USING A COMBINATION OF THEORY, NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS, AND ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA. SINCE THE BEHAVIOR OF SUSPENSIONS IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN EXPERIMENTS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT SHOW GOOD AGREEMENT, THEY ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM FOR EXPLORING THE LARGER QUESTION OF HOW MATERIALS CHANGE PROPERTIES DUE TO FLOW CONDITIONS.

THIS WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY ANALYSIS OF DIVERGENT SHEAR AND NORMAL STRESS AS JAMMING IS APPROACHED; THE ANALYSIS WILL APPLY METHODS OF CROSSOVER SCALING, A RENORMALIZATION GROUP METHOD ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN BEHAVIOR IS INFLUENCED BY TWO SINGULAR POINTS: THIS IS SEEN IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS IT UNDERGOES TWO FORMS OF JAMMING, ONE DUE TO GEOMETRICALLY-DETERMINED FRICTIONLESS CONTACTS AT VANISHING STRESS AND THE OTHER DUE TO STRESS-INDUCED FRICTIONAL CONTACTS AT LARGE STRESS. THE CONTINUUM DESCRIPTION OF SUSPENSION FLOW IN A NOVEL DIRECTION, BY EXTENSION OF RECENT APPROACHES TO DESCRIBE THE EMERGENT ELASTICITY OF JAMMED AMORPHOUS PACKINGS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. THIS DIRECTION OF WORK IS BASED ON A POSTULATE THAT RIGIDITY ON PROGRESSIVELY LARGER SCALES IS INDUCED BY INCREASE OF THE STRESS, WHICH IN A SUFFICIENTLY DENSE SUSPENSION LEADS TO A PERCOLATION OF RIGIDITY AND JAMMING; THE CONTINUUM THEORY IS BASED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF MOTION CORRELATIONS BY SIMULATION.

FLOW PHENOMENA IN NATURE AND IN ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE TYPICALLY DRIVEN BY EXTERNAL FORCES SUCH AS GRAVITY AND PRESSURE GRADIENTS. CONTINUUM MECHANICS IS THE MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO DESCRIBE SUCH FLOWS AND HENCE PREDICT AND DESIGN THEM. IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE CELL CYTOSKELETON, FLOW PHENOMENA ARE GENERATED BY INTERNAL DRIVING, POWERED BY PROTEINS AND OTHER BIOCHEMICAL MACHINES THAT CONSUME CHEMICAL ENERGY. CONTINUUM MECHANICAL DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO SUCH INTERNALLY DRIVEN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS IN RECENT YEARS WITH GREAT SUCCESS. SO FAR, EFFORTS HAVE CENTERED AROUND SINGLE-COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS. IN ACTUALITY, THESE ARE MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEMS. DEVELOPING MULTICOMPONENT CONTINUUM THEORIES FOR INTERNALLY DRIVEN FLUIDS REQUIRES OVERCOMING SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THIS PROJECT USES MULTI-SCALE THEORY COUPLED WITH DATA DRIVEN TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS THESE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND HENCE DEVELOP MODELS FOR MULTI-COMPONENT BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS. THIS PROJECT IS A STEP TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO FUNCTION IN NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, DESIGNING AND CONTROLLING INTERNALLY DRIVEN FLUIDS IS KEY TO ENGINEERING RAPIDLY RECONFIGURABLE LIFE-LIKE MATERIALS, WITH APPLICATIONS IN FIELDS AS DIVERSE AS ROBOTICS, MICROFLUIDICS, AND ADAPTIVE OPTICS. IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENCE OUTCOMES, THE RESEARCH IS INTEGRATED WITH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH INITIATIVES INCLUDING : (I) CONTENT FOR AN ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ON SOFT MATERIALS THEORY ?

TECHNICAL SUMMARY THIS AWARD SUPPORTS THEORETICAL, COMPUTATIONAL, AND DATA-INTENSIVE RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING PREDICTIVE CONTINUUM DESCRIPTIONS OF COMPOSITE ACTIVE FLUIDS. ACTIVE FLUIDS ARE COMPOSED OF MICROSCOPIC ENTITIES THAT CONSUME ENERGY AND EXERT FORCES. THIS PARADIGM INCLUDES DIVERSE SYSTEMS FROM BACTERIAL SUSPENSIONS TO CYTOSKELETAL FILAMENTS PROPELLED BY MOLECULAR MOTORS AND SYNTHETIC DIFFUSOPHORETIC COLLOIDS. CONTINUUM DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DYNAMICS OF THESE FLUIDS HAVE BEEN POWERFUL IN IDENTIFYING TRANSFERABLE CONCEPTS THAT ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND, CONTROL, AND EVEN PREDICTIVELY DESIGN ACTIVE FLUIDS. RESEARCH TO DATE HAS FOCUSED ON SINGLE COMPONENT FLUID DYNAMIC DESCRIPTIONS OF ACTIVE MATERIALS. BUT EXPERIMENTAL PHENOMENOLOGY CLEARLY SHOWS THE NEED FOR MULTI-COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR DENSITY GRADIENTS IN DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. BUILDING MACROSCOPIC THEORIES OF MULTI-COMPONENT SYSTEMS IS CHALLENGING EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF TRADITIONAL EQUILIBRATING FLUIDS. ONE NEEDS TO INVOKE CONSIDERATIONS OF RECIPROCITY AND ENTROPY PRODUCTION TO DETERMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FLUXES IN THE DYNAMICS OF CONSERVED QUANTITIES. ACTIVE FLUIDS, BEING INHERENTLY OUT OF EQUILIBRIUM ARE LIBERATED FROM THESE CONSTRAINTS. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES DATA DRIVEN MODEL DEVELOPMENT WITH THE STANDARD TECHNIQUES OF SOFT MATERIALS PHYSICS. ON THE ONE HAND, PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONTINUUM MECHANICS WILL BE COMBINED WITH SYSTEMATIC NONEQUILIBRIUM STATISTICAL MECHANICS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE MECHANISMS AT PLAY IN DETERMINING THE EMERGENT BEHAVIOR IN COMPOSITE ACTIVE FLUIDS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A COMPLEMENTARY DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH IS DEVELOPED, THAT LEVERAGES EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM IN-VITRO CYTOSKELETAL SUSPENSION EXPERIMENTS TO GUIDE MODEL DISCOVERY. THIS PROJECT IS AIMED TO YIELD FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO NON-RECIPROCAL CROSS DIFFUSION PROCESSES AND THEIR ROLE IN EMERGENT BEHAVIOR IN ACTIVE COMPOSITE FLUIDS. THIS EFFORT IS A FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO FUNCTION IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, DESIGNING AND CONTROLLING ACTIVE STRESSES IS KEY TO ENGINEERING RAPIDLY RECONFIGURABLE LIFE-LIKE MATERIALS, WITH APPLICATIONS IN FIELDS AS DIVERSE AS ROBOTICS, MICROFLUIDICS AND ADAPTIVE OPTICS. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO ENGINEER ACTIVE STRESS IN MATERIALS. INTEGRATED WITH THE RESEARCH EFFORT, THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN PHYSICS EDUCATION THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES: (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT FOR AN ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ON SOFT MATERIALS THEORY ?

WHILE MANY BRAIN REGIONS INTERACT TO ENABLE COGNITIVE PROCESSES OF LEARNING AND DECISION MAKING, THE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPUS OF THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE ARE CENTRAL NODES IN THE UNDERLYING NEURAL CIRCUIT. ACCORDINGLY, MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IS A HALLMARK OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, PTSD AND OTHER ANXIETY DISORDERS, EPILEPSY, AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE. UNDERSTANDING BASIC NEURAL FUNCTION AND COORDINATION PROCESSES IN THE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPUS DURING MEMORY AND DECISION MAKING WILL THEREFORE BE CRUCIAL IN THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR THESE DISORDERS; HOWEVER, SUBICULUM FUNCTION AND ITS COORDINATION WITH HIPPOCAMPUS DURING THESE COGNITIVE TASKS IS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNKNOWN. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT SUBICULUM LINKS INDIVIDUAL MEMORIES FORMED BY THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THEREBY ENABLES COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS ABSTRACTION, CATEGORIZATION, AND DELIBERATION DURING DECISION MAKING. DURING THE MENTORED PHASE (K99), HIGH-DENSITY IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY WILL BE USED IN RATS TO OBSERVE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPAL SUBREGION CA1 ACTIVITY DURING A NAVIGATIONAL MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING TASK. OPTOGENETIC INTERRUPTION OF THE PROPOSED COORDINATION MECHANISM BETWEEN SUBICULUM AND CA1 DURING BEHAVIOR WILL THEN PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO ITS NECESSITY FOR MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING. THEORETICAL MODELS WILL ASSESS PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE FORMATION OF SUBICULUM ACTIVITY PATTERNS. EXPERIMENTS DURING THE INDEPENDENT (R00) PHASE WILL EXTEND THIS APPROACH THROUGH THE DORSAL-VENTRAL EXTENT OF CA1 AND SUBICULUM AND TO EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF MEMORY SUCH AS HEDONIC VALUE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN TWO SIGNIFICANT CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGHS: 1) SUBICULUM IS A MAJOR AND CRITICAL COMPONENT OF HIPPOCAMPAL OUTPUT WITH SPECIFIC AND DISTINCT FUNCTIONS DURING MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING, 2) SUBICULUM AND CA1 FUNCTION AND ENCODING PROPERTIES ARE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THEIR DORSAL-VENTRAL EXTENTS AND ARE BEST UNDERSTOOD UNDER A SINGLE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK.

UNIFORM MEANING REPRESENTATION (UMR) IS DESIGNED AS A MACHINE-READABLE LANGUAGE THAT ALL LANGUAGES, FROM HIGH-RESOURCE LANGUAGES SUCH AS ENGLISH AND CHINESE, TO LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGES LIKE ARAPAHO, CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO. UMR CAN ALSO BE EXTENDED TO MULTI-MODAL SETTINGS TO REPRESENT THE CONTENT OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES, ALLOWING COMPUTERS TO BETTER PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OF THESE MEDIA FORMS.

THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES TOOLS USED TO FACILITATE THE TRANSLATION OF HUMAN LANGUAGE TO UMRS, METRICS THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF UMRS, AND AN INITIAL COLLECTION OF UMRS FOR FIVE LANGUAGES THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES: ENGLISH, CHINESE, ARABIC, ARAPAHO, AND QUECHUA, AS WELL AS VIDEO CONTENT THAT INCLUDES BOTH LANGUAGE AND GESTURES FOR TWO OF THOSE LANGUAGES.. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES OUTREACH EFFORTS TO ENGAGE FELLOW RESEARCHERS TO PRODUCE UMRS FOR ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND GENRES WITH TUTORIALS, WORKSHOPS, SUMMER SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS ONLINE TRAINING MATERIALS. ONCE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF UMRS ARE CREATED FOR A LANGUAGE, COMPUTER MODELS AND ALGORITHMS CAN BE TRAINED ON THESE UMRS TO AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE MORE UMRS FOR NEW DATA IN THAT LANGUAGE. THEY CAN THEN BE USED TO ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DOWNSTREAM HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES, RANGING FROM HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTION TO DIALOGUE SYSTEMS, FROM INFORMATION EXTRACTION TO QUESTION ANSWERING, FROM MACHINE TRANSLATION TO TEXT SUMMARIZATION. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PRODUCE UMRS FOR UNDER-RESOURCED LANGUAGES AND HELP BRING MODERN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO SPEAKERS OF THOSE LANGUAGES, AS WELL AS PEOPLE WORKING ON THE DOCUMENTATION AND/OR REVITALIZATION OF THE LANGUAGES. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF LINGUISTS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS TO JOINTLY BUILD AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UNIFORM MEANING REPRESENTATION (UMR), A PRACTICAL, FORMAL, COMPUTATIONALLY TRACTABLE, AND CROSS-LINGUISTICALLY VALID DOCUMENT-LEVEL MEANING REPRESENTATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE THAT CAN IMPACT A WIDE RANGE OF DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE ?DEEP? NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING (NLU). THE UMR INFRASTRUCTURE WILL CONSIST OF UMR-ANNOTATED DATA SETS FOR FIVE LANGUAGES, INCLUDING MULTIMODAL DATA SETS FOR TWO OF THOSE LANGUAGES, ENGLISH AND ARAPAHO, A UMR ANNOTATION INTERFACE AND RELEVANT TRAINING MATERIALS, BASELINE UMR PARSING MODELS THAT FELLOW NLP RESEARCHERS CAN USE AS A POINT OF COMPARISON WHEN DEVELOPING MORE ADVANCED UMR PARSING MODELS, METRICS FOR EVALUATING DOCUMENT-LEVEL MEANING REPRESENTATIONS, AND A PLATFORM FOR DISSEMINATING THE UMR DATA SETS, TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO USERS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF OUTREACH EFFORTS CONSISTING OF WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SUMMER SCHOOLS, AND A SHARED TASK AT THE END OF THE PROJECT TO INVOLVE FELLOW RESEARCHERS IN THE NLP COMMUNITY TO PRODUCE UMRS FOR ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND PROMOTE THE USE OF THE UMR INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEANING REPRESENTATION PARSING RESEARCH AND DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS.

IT HAS BEEN APPRECIATED FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THAT NUCLEAR SIZE SCALES WITH CELL SIZE, SO THAT LARGER CELLS HAVE LARGER NUCLEI. AS CELLS GROW, THE NUCLEUS GROWS AT THE SAME RATE. THIS SIZE SCALING RELATIONSHIP IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF LIFE, BUT THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR NUCLEAR SIZE REGULATION ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. DECIPHERING SUCH MECHANISMS WILL GIVE INSIGHTS INTO WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CELLS TO REGULATE NUCLEAR SIZE AND WILL PROVIDE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW SIZE REGULATION OF CELLS AND ORGANELLES IS ACCOMPLISHED. IN GENERAL, THIS WORK WILL ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF FUNDAMENTAL CELLULAR PROCESSES THAT ARE USED TO BUILD LIVING CELLS. AS A BROADER OUTCOME, THIS PROJECT WILL INTRODUCE TO THE LARGER PUBLIC THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL FORCES AND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS IN CELL BIOLOGY RESEARCH THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL MODULES AND A SCIENTIFIC EXHIBIT. IN THIS PROJECT, A QUANTITATIVE MODEL FOR NUCLEAR SIZE SCALING WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS MODEL PROPOSES THAT NUCLEAR SIZE IS SPECIFIED BY PHYSICAL FACTORS SUCH AS OSMOTIC PRESSURE AND MEMBRANE TENSION. SPECIFICALLY, NUCLEAR SIZE MAY BE DETERMINED LARGELY BY A BALANCE OF COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURES WITHIN THE NUCLEOPLASM AND CYTOPLASM, WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY THE NUMBERS OF OSMOTICALLY ACTIVE MACROMOLECULES PRESENT IN EACH COMPARTMENT. THE GENERAL APPROACH IS TO USE THEORETICAL MODELING COUPLED WITH QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE FISSION YEAST SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES POMBE AS A MODEL ORGANISM. IN S. POMBE, THE NUCLEUS BEHAVES AS AN ?IDEAL OSMOMETER? WHOSE SIZE CORRESPONDS QUANTITATIVELY TO ITS OSMOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS MODEL WILL BE TESTED IN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH PHYSICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS OSMOTIC PRESSURE ARE VARIED.

THE STUDY OF CRYSTALLIZATION HAS LED TO FUNDAMENTAL DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW WATER FREEZES TO BECOME ICE. CRYSTALLIZATION IS ALSO CENTRAL TO A WIDE VARIETY OF IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES, RANGING FROM MICROELECTRONICS TO PHARMACEUTICALS. YET, DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF CRYSTALLIZATION IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCE, MANY MYSTERIES REGARDING THE DYNAMICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION REMAIN. THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS BY WHICH CRYSTALS FORM AND TO USE THAT UNDERSTANDING TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR MAKING MACROSCOPIC SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH EXOTIC MATERIALS PROPERTIES. THE RESEARCH WILL REVEAL NEW FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR PROGRAMMABLE NANOMATERIALS OF THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD FIND APPLICATIONS IN OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS, LIGHT-HARVESTING, AND OTHER NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH PROJECT ALSO TRAINS STUDENTS IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD OF SOFT CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AND ENGAGES THE PUBLIC IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SCIENCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS DEVELOPING STUDENT-LED, STUDENT-FOCUSED SUMMER PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRACTICAL HANDS-ON TRAINING IN THE LABORATORY, WHILE ALSO PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION BY CREATING A COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS AND REINFORCING GROUP COHESION. THE TEAM IS ALSO CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH A LOCAL SCIENCE MUSEUM FOCUSED ON ENHANCING INTEREST AND SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC DRIVING FORCES THAT GOVERN THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS TO CRYSTALLIZATION, AND TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THOSE PATHWAYS TO CREATE NEW OPTICAL METAMATERIALS FROM DNA-COATED COLLOIDS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS ORGANIZED AROUND TWO SPECIFIC STUDIES. IN THE FIRST STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS EXPLORING HOW THE KINETICS OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH EMERGE FROM THE PAIR-INTERACTION POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS THE DETAILS OF THE PARENT FLUID PHASE AND THE CHILD CRYSTAL PHASE. THE RESEARCH TEAM USES AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH COMBINING DROPLET-BASED MICROFLUIDICS WITH OPTICAL MICROSCOPY TO SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFY THE FULL DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF HUNDREDS OF EXPERIMENTS RUNNING IN PARALLEL. THEY ARE ALSO DEVELOPING A SUITE OF THEORETICAL TOOLS BASED ON THE STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF MULTIVALENT INTERACTIONS, CLASSICAL NUCLEATION THEORY, AND CLASSICAL THEORIES OF CRYSTAL GROWTH TO UNCOVER MICROSCOPIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRYSTALLIZATION PATHWAYS AND TO CREATE A DATA-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF THEIR EXPERIMENTS. IN THE SECOND STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS UTILIZING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH TO CREATE RATIONAL NONEQUILIBRIUM PROTOCOLS FOR FORMING SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH PRESCRIBED STRUCTURES, WHICH COULD BE USED IN FUTURE APPLICATIONS IN PHOTONICS AND PLASMONICS. HERE THEY DRAW INSPIRATION FROM TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRACTICES, SUCH AS SLOW TEMPERATURE RAMPS, TEMPERATURE CYCLING, MULTISTEP NUCLEATION AND GROWTH PROTOCOLS, AND SEEDED NUCLEATION. WHILE EXISTING STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EXPANDING THE DIVERSITY OF STATIC STRUCTURES THAT FORM IN EQUILIBRIUM, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS WORKING TO UNDERSTAND THE RICH DYNAMICAL PATHWAYS BY WHICH THOSE STRUCTURES SELF-ASSEMBLE AND TO DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO CONTROL THOSE PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE MACROSCOPIC PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS FROM COLLOIDS.

THE LC IS STRUCTURALLY CONNECTED TO THE TEMPORAL LOBE AND MAY PLAY A ROLE IN TRANSMITTING ABNORMAL TAU THROUGH TRANS-NEURONAL SPREAD. THE LC IS THE PRIMARY PRODUCER OF THE NEUROMODULATOR NOREPINEPHRINE. NOREPINEPHRINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR NORMAL ATTENTION AND MEMORY FUNCTION. BEYOND A ROLE IN COGNITION, NOREPINEPHRINE SERVES A MYRIAD OF NEUROPROTECTIVE ROLES WHICH INCLUDE INHIBITION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS, MAINTENANCE OF THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER, AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF HYPERPHOSPHORYLATED TAU IN THE LC HAS BEEN LINKED WITH LOSS OF NOREPINEPHRINE-PRODUCING LC NEURONS. THE TARGETING AND NEURODEGENERATION OF LC IS PARTICULARLY INSIDIOUS DUE TO THE COMBINED LOSS OF COGNITION-ENHANCING NEUROMODULATION AND LOSS OF NEUROPROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR DISEASE ACCELERATION AND PROPAGATION.

ADVANCED MATERIALS ARE ESSENTIAL TO NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN LIFE, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH, NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND MANY OTHERS. COMBINING TWO DISPARATE MATERIALS, SUCH AS RELATIVELY SOFT POLYMERS (E.G., PLASTICS) AND HARD SOLIDS (E.G., CERAMICS, CLAYS, ETC.), CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MAKING NEW COMPOSITES COMBINING THE BEST PROPERTIES OF BOTH MATERIALS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, THOROUGHLY COMBINING SUCH MATERIALS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. IN THIS EFFORT, A SERIES OF HIGHLY ADVANCED EXPERIMENTAL AND SIMULATION TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO ELUCIDATE THE INTERACTIONS OF POLYMERS WITH A CLASS OF SOLIDS KNOWN AS METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOFS). INSIGHTS INTO THE INTERFACE AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLYMERS AND MOFS WILL ENABLE THEIR MORE EFFECTIVE COMBINATION FOR MAKING HYBRID MATERIALS WITH INTRIGUING AND UNPRECEDENTED PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION TO THESE STUDIES, THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON, DC, WHERE THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN INTERNSHIPS AT THE INTERFACE OF PUBLIC POLICY AND SCIENCE THROUGH THE SCIENCE POLICY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (SPIP). TECHNICAL ABSTRACT COMBINING ORGANIC POLYMERS AND METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOFS) HAS PROVEN AN IMPORTANT AREA OF RESEARCH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYBRID, COMPOSITE MATERIALS THAT POSSESS FAVORABLE PROPERTIES OF BOTH COMPONENTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE TWO DISPARATE MATERIALS INTERACT AT THE MOLECULAR SCALE. THIS EFFORT EXPLORES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOFT, ORGANIC POLYMERS AND HARD, INORGANIC MOFS USING A COMBINATION OF SYNTHESIS, SPECTROSCOPY, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND SIMULATIONS. STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) TECHNIQUES, COUPLED WITH SCANNING- AND TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM, TEM) AS WELL AS ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, ARE USED TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTIONS OF POLYMERS WITH MOFS IN THREE TYPES OF COMPOSITES: MIXED-MATRIX MEMBRANES (MMMS), MOF BRUSH POLYMERS, AND POLYMER-DERIVED MOFS (A.K.A. POLYMOFS). ULTIMATELY, THE FINDINGS FROM THESE STUDIES WILL BE AMONG THE MOST DETAILED INVESTIGATIONS OF MOF?POLYMER INTERFACES AND WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE HYBRID MATERIALS TOWARD TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS.

PROFESSOR XU IS DEVELOPING NEW, MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS FOR CONVERTING READILY AVAILABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO MORE VALUABLE MOLECULES THAT CONTAIN ONE OR MORE NITROGEN ATOMS. A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL-MOLECULE PHARMACEUTICALS AND FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS CONTAIN NITROGEN ATOMS, A SITUATION THAT MAKES THE CHEMISTRY BEING DEVELOPED BOTH TIMELY AND IMPORTANT FOR ADDRESSING MODERN SYNTHETIC NEEDS. THE CHEMISTRY IS ALSO MORE SUSTAINABLE THAT THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS BECAUSE THE REAGENTS USED BY PROFESSOR XU AND HIS STUDENTS ARE DERIVED FROM IRON - THE SECOND MOST ABUNDANT METAL IN THE EARTH'S CRUST - AND STABLE, COMMON PEROXIDES. THESE SIMPLE REAGENTS REPLACE THE MUCH MORE RARE AND EXPENSIVE REAGENTS TYPICALLY USED FOR THE CURRENT METHODS. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM LIES AT THE INTERFACE OF ORGANIC, INORGANIC, AND MECHANISTIC CHEMISTRY; THEREFORE, IT PROVIDES A UNIQUE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL LEVELS OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ATTEND GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND PROFESSOR XU'S STRONG COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THOSE STUDENTS. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM AIMS TO DEVELOP AND STUDY NOVEL SYNTHETIC APPROACHES THAT HARNESS STABLE PEROXIDES TO SELECTIVELY FUNCTIONALIZE A BROAD RANGE OF OLEFINS WITH NON-OXYGEN-BASED GROUPS. IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, PROFESSOR XU AND HIS STUDENTS ARE EXPLORING THE REACTIVITY OF UNIQUE IRON COMPLEXES WITH STABLE PEROXIDES AND DEVELOPING AN IRON-CATALYZED METHOD FOR SELECTIVE OLEFIN DIAZIDATION/DIAMINATION REACTIONS. THE WORK IS EXPANDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRON-CATALYZED PROCESS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF OLEFINS AND N-HETEROCYCLES. IN THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, THE GROUP IS EXPLORING NEW IRON-CATALYZED ACTIVATION APPROACHES FOR FLUOROALKYL TRANSFER REACTIONS. THE WORK IS PROVIDING A GENERAL AND SELECTIVE APPROACH FOR OLEFIN FUNCTIONALIZATION THAT WILL LIKELY BECOME A USEFUL TOOL FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTS. IN TERMS OF BROADER IMPACT, THIS PROJECT IS INTEGRATING THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS FOR CONSTRUCTING VALUE ADDED MOLECULES WITH EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE I) TRANSFORMING TEACHING WITH UNDERGRADUATE MENTORING AND RESEARCH AND (II) PROVIDING SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND VISITING STUDENTS.

NEURONAL EVS MEDIATE ACTIVITY- DEPENDENT SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY, AS WELL AS THE SPREAD AND CLEARANCE OF TOXIC PROTEIN AGGREGATES ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS SUCH AS ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND PARKINSON’S DISEASE. EV BIOGENESIS AND SECRETION OCCURS VIA ENDOSOMAL TRAFFICKING, BUT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH NEURONAL ACTIVITY REGULATES THESE CELL BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES HAVE NOT BEEN WELL CHARACTERIZED. BY IDENTIFYING ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT MECHANISMS INFLUENCING NEURONAL EV DYNAMICS, WE WILL GAIN GREATER INSIGHT INTO BASIC AND PATHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY OF EV RESEARCH UTILIZES IN VITRO NON-NEURONAL CELL MODELS TO ISOLATE HETEROGENOUS EV POPULATIONS, MAKING DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF NEURONAL EV BIOGENESIS AND TRAFFICKING MECHANISMS CHALLENGING. THE DROSOPHILA NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION (NMJ) SERVES AS A POWERFUL IN VIVO MODEL THAT IS HIGHLY AMENABLE TO MANIPULATING AND VISUALIZING EV CARGO. MY PRELIMINARY FINDINGS IN THIS SYSTEM SUGGEST THAT CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II (CAMKII), A KEY SYNAPTIC PROTEIN INVOLVED IN STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL FORMS OF SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY, PLAYS A ROLE IN EV TRAFFICKING. SPECIFICALLY, CAMKII NULL MUTANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED LEVELS OF THE EV CARGO SYT4 IN BOTH EV PRECURSORS IN THE PRESYNAPTIC NEURON AND POSTSYNAPTICALLY SECRETED EVS. SYT4 MODULATES NMJ SYNAPTIC GROWTH AND NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE IN AN ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT MANNER, LEADING TO MY HYPOTHESIS THAT CAMKII REGULATES SYT4 EV SIGNALING TO PROMOTE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY. IN AIM 1, I WILL ASK IF CAMKII CONTROLS EV CARGO LEVELS IN AN ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING PATHWAY THAT WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED TO MEDIATE EV CARGO TRAFFICKING. IN THE SECOND AIM, I WILL ELUCIDATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAMKII AND SYT4 AND TEST IF THEY ACT IN A SHARED PATHWAY TO PROMOTE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY. IN AIM 3, I WILL ISOLATE THE SPECIFIC CAMKII FUNCTION(S) INVOLVED IN EV CARGO AND TRAFFICKING REGULATION. THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE TRAINING IN ADVANCED IMAGING, QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS, DROSOPHILA GENETICS, AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY.

THIS “IDENTITY” HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE BOTH SINGULAR (I.E. ONE TRANSMITTER) AND IMMUTABLE (I.E. GENETICALLY HARDWIRED). WHILE THE ASTONISHING PREVALENCE OF COTRANSMISSION HAS CHANGED THINKING ABOUT THE SINGULARITY OF NEUROTRANSMITTER IDENTITY THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS APPRECIATION OF THE ABILITY OF NEURONS TO EXHIBIT PLASTICITY IN THEIR EXPRESSION. RECENTLY, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE MICRORNA MIR-190 IS A POTENT REGULATOR OF ADULT SLEEP. SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL MAPPING OF ITS SITE OF ACTION DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS REQUIRED DURING PUPATION IN A POPULATION OF CELLS THAT TRANSCRIBES BOTH CHOLINERGIC AND GLUTAMATERGIC GENES BUT DIFFERENTIATES TO BECOME A SMALL SUBSET OF THE ADULT GLUTAMATERGIC NEURONS. THIS SUBSET INCLUDES COMPONENTS OF THE CORE SLEEP HOMEOSTASIS CIRCUIT. WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A NEUROTRANSMITTER PLASTICITY EVENT IS CRITICAL TO FUNCTION OF THE MATURE CIRCUIT AND THAT IT PROVIDES A NOVEL MECHANISM FOR ESTABLISHING, AND POTENTIALLY MODIFYING, THE SLEEP SET-POINT OF THE HOMEOSTATIC MACHINERY. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF NEUROTRANSMITTER PLASTICITY IN THE CONTROL OF ADULT SLEEP, WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE CIRCUIT-LEVEL CHANGES. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY IN TRANSMITTER SWITCHING AND HOMEOSTAT PLASTICITY, WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR EVENTS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE BRING THE POWER OF DROSOPHILA GENETICS TO BEAR ON THIS NOVEL AND IMPORTANT TYPE OF PLASTICITY. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PROGRAMMED TRANSMITTER PLASTICITY DURING PUPAL LIFE IS CRUCIAL TO ADULT FUNCTION OF THE SLEEP CIRCUITRY.

THE RIGOR OF PRIOR RESEARCH IS THAT (I) OVEREXPRESSION OF ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (ALP) IS A KEY FEATURE OF MOS, (II) OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT EISA FORMS NFS INSIDE NUCLEI TO SELECTIVELY INHIBIT MOS CELLS, AND (III) EISA FORMS CYTOSOLIC NFS TO SELECTIVELY INHIBIT MOS TUMORS IN VIVO.

EXOSOMES ARE SMALL EXTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE-BOUND VESICLES THAT CARRY PROTEINS, LIPIDS, DNA AND/OR RNA FROM DONOR CELL TO RECIPIENT CELL FOR DISPOSAL OR INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION. IN NEURONS, EXOSOMES CAN FACILITATE BOTH THE CLEARANCE AND SPREAD OF TOXIC PROTEINS IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. EXOSOMES ARE FORMED BY INVAGINATION OF THE ENDOSOMAL MEMBRANE TO CREATE A MULTIVESICULAR BODY (MVB) WHICH THEN FUSES TO THE PLASMA MEMBRANE, RELEASING ITS INTRALUMENAL VESICLES (ILVS) INTO THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACE. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE COMES LARGELY FROM WORK DONE IN IN VITRO NON-NEURONAL CELL SYSTEMS, AND WHILE MANY OF THE MOLECULES AND PATHWAYS INVOLVED WERE IDENTIFIED IN THESE SYSTEMS, EXPLORING NEURONAL EXOSOME AND ENDOSOME BIOLOGY IN AN ANIMAL WILL BE CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING NEURON-SPECIFIC AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE. IN PARTICULAR, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHEN AND WHERE MVBS ARE GENERATED IN NEURONS, AND HOW EXOSOME-DIRECTED MVBS ARE PROTECTED FROM CONVENTIONAL LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION. THE DROSOPHILA NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION (NMJ) IS AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM TO STUDY EXOSOME BIOLOGY IN VIVO, AND OUR LAB HAS DEVELOPED TOOLS TO TRACK ENDOGENOUSLY LABELED EXOSOME CARGOES. THESE TOOLS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH EASY GENETIC MANIPULATION AND IMAGEABILITY OF THE DROSOPHILA NMJ, MAKES IT A GREAT SYSTEM TO STUDY EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO PATHWAYS (ESCRT AND MUNC13- 4/RAB11) WHICH WE WILL MANIPULATE TO INVESTIGATE ENDOSOMAL DYNAMICS SURROUNDING THE FORMATION OF THE MVB AND EXOSOME RELEASE. THE ESCRT (ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEXES REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT) PATHWAY IS INVOLVED IN FORMATION OF THE ILVS FROM WHICH EXOSOMES ARISE. I HAVE SHOWN THAT LOSS OF TSG101, AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE ESCRT PATHWAY, LEADS TO A LOSS OF EXOSOME RELEASE AND AN INCREASE IN PRESYNAPTIC CARGO LEVELS. BY TRACKING AND MANIPULATING TSG101, I WILL DETERMINE THE SUBCELLULAR DISTRIBUTION AND DYNAMICS OF EXOSOMAL MVBS AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FORMATION OF ILVS/MVBS IS TEMPORALLY AND INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO CARGO DISTRIBUTION, ENDOSOME MATURATION STATE, AND EXOSOME CARGO FUNCTION (AIM 1). PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A REQUIREMENT FOR MUNC13-4 IN EXOSOME RELEASE, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECYCLING ENDOSOME (RE) PROTEIN, RAB11. IN COMBINATION WITH OUR WORK SHOWING THAT LOSS OF RAB11 LEADS TO DECREASED EXOSOME CARGO LEVELS, WE WILL USE THIS PATHWAY AS A TOOL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN RES AND MVBS PROMOTES RELEASE OF EXOSOMES AT THE PLASMA MEMBRANE (AIM 2). THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL I WILL EXPAND MY SKILLSETS IN MICROSCOPY, INCLUDING HIGH-RESOLUTION AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS AND DROSOPHILA GENETICS. I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED PLANS TO IMPROVE MY MENTORSHIP, LEADERSHIP AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

THE LC IS THE BRAIN’S PRIMARY GENERATOR OF THE NEUROMODULATOR NOREPINEPHRINE (NE) AND IS ONE OF THE FIRST BRAIN REGIONS TO ACCUMULATE HYPERPHOSPHORYLATED TAU PROTEIN, A HALLMARK PATHOLOGICAL AGENT IN AD. THE ABILITY TO USE MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) IMAGING TO ASSESS LC INTEGRITY OPENS UP EXCITING POSSIBILITIES FOR EARLIEST DETECTION OF DISEASE ACCELERATION, AND MAY ALSO PROVIDE AN MR MEASURE THAT CAPTURES INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN NEUROCHEMICAL FUNCTION. THE ABILITY TO STUDY NEUROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN VIVO IN HUMANS IS LIMITED, WITH IMAGING APPROACHES USING RADIOACTIVE TRACERS BEING THE MOST ESTABLISHED (E.G. POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)). HOWEVER, DUE TO THE BURDEN TO SUBJECTS, AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURAL CHALLENGES, PET IMAGING IS NOT A TOOL MANY RESEARCHERS USE DESPITE THE CENTRAL ROLE NEUROMODULATORY SYSTEMS LIKE NE PLAY IN BASIC COGNITION AND DISEASE. WE WILL TAKE INITIAL STEPS TOWARDS TESTING THE VALIDITY OF LC MR MEASURES FOR PREDICTING NE FUNCTION BY EXAMINING THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A NEUROMELANIN-SENSITIVE MR MEASURE OF LC INTEGRITY AND A PET MEASURE OF CATECHOLAMINE (NOREPINEPHRINE/DOPAMINE) SYNTHESIS CAPACITY ([18F]FLUORO-L-M-TYROSINE (FMT)) WITHIN SUBJECT IN HEALTHY YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS (AIM 1). ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE IN HEALTHY AGING, AD, AND PARKINSON’S DISEASE SUGGESTS THE CATECHOLAMINE SYSTEM RESPONDS TO INJURY AND SHOWS COMPENSATORY CAPACITY.

WHILE IT IS CRITICAL THAT UPON CELL-CELL CONTACT, NEW SYNAPSES FORM THE CORRECT POSTSYNAPTIC SPECIALIZATION (EXCITATORY OR INHIBITORY), THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS SPECIFYING THIS IDENTITY REMAIN A FUNDAMENTAL MYSTERY IN DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY. THIS PROCESS IS PRESUMABLY REGULATED BY TRANS-SYNAPTIC LIGAND/RECEPTOR PARTNERS THAT BELONG TO PROTEIN FAMILIES (E.G. NEUROLIGINS/NEUREXINS, EPHRINS/EPHS, SEMAPHORINS/PLEXINS) WHICH HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO REGULATE BOTH EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION. SEMAPHORINS (SEMAS) AND PLEXINS ARE FAMILIES OF WIDELY EXPRESSED AND FUNCTIONALLY VERSATILE TRANSMEMBRANE OR SECRETED LIGANDS AND THEIR TRANSMEMBRANE RECEPTORS THAT FIRST GAINED ATTENTION FOR THEIR ROLES IN AXON GUIDANCE DURING NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. CLASS 4 SEMAS AND PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS ARE EXPRESSED IN MAMMALIAN HIPPOCAMPUS (IN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY NEURONS AND IN GLIA) AND PROMOTE SYNAPSE FORMATION BOTH DURING DEVELOPMENT AND IN ADULTHOOD. OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES REVEALED SEMA4D TO BE ONE OF FEW MOLECULES HAVING SYNAPTOGENIC FUNCTION RESTRICTED TO INHIBITORY SYNAPSES; THE EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN OF SEMA4D INDUCES INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION ON A RAPID TIMESCALE (~30 MINS) THROUGH THE PLEXIN-B1 RECEPTOR. ADDITIONALLY, SEMA4A PROMOTES FORMATION OF BOTH INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SYNAPSES IN HIPPOCAMPUS VIA THE PLEXIN-B1 OR PLEXIN-B2 RECEPTORS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY DRIVE SYNAPSE FORMATION BY APPLICATION OF SEMA4A OR SEMA4D, AS WELL AS THE OBSERVATIONS THAT THESE SEMAS REGULATE INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SYNAPSE FORMATION IN UNIQUE WAYS REQUIRING DIFFERENT PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS, ARE CENTRAL TO OUR PROPOSED STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY THE DISTINCT SIGNALING CONFORMATIONS THAT INSTRUCT SYNAPSE IDENTITY (EXCITATORY OR INHIBITORY) DOWNSTREAM OF PLEXIN-B RECEPTOR ENGAGEMENT. FURTHER, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT SEMA4D PROTEIN APPLICATION INCREASES RESILIENCE TO SEIZURE IN ADULT MICE IN VIVO, A FINDING THAT SUPPORTS THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL IMPACT OF THIS WORK. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH USES A COMBINATION OF TRANSGENIC MICE, ORGANOTYPIC HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE CULTURE, GENE KNOCKDOWN, AND EXPRESSION OF MUTANT FORMS OF PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS TO EXAMINE THE DIVERGENT ROLES OF 1) UNIQUE PLEXIN-B SIGNALING DOMAINS, 2) A NOVEL MECHANISM GATING PLEXIN-B1 SIGNALING IN CIS, AND 3) CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PLEXIN-B CORECEPTORS, IN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION PROMOTED BY CLASS 4 SEMAPHORINS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F31NS118799_7529/,2023-01-19
